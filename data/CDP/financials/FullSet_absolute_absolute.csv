We committed to reducing absolute GHG emissions (scope 1 and 2) to 65% of 2000 levels by 2015. At the end of 2015, our reduction had reached an impressive 70%, and Resolute's participation in the program was completed with the expiration of the five-year term of the agreement. By the end of 2018, we had lowered GHG emissions by 81%, and we began the process of setting a new target. This achievement reflects a company-wide focus on improved energy efficiency and has led to switching from fossil fuels to less carbon-intensive energy sources, such as hydroelectricity, carbon-neutral biomass, and natural gas. Our 65% goal was an industry-leading GHG reduction target, and we want to ensure our next goal and future commitments will still reflect our leadership in this matter. As a member of the Forest Products Association of Canada (FPAC), Resolute has signed on to its ''30 by 30\" Climate Change Challenge, which commits the Canadian forest products industry to removing 30 megatons of CO2 per year by 2030 - more than 13% of the Canadian government's total emission reduction target. This target covers our facilities located in Canada. For our facilities located in the United States, we are working with the American Forest and Paper Association (AFPA) to support its goal of achieving at least a 20% reduction of member GHG emissions (intensity) from 2005 levels by 2020. Between 2005 and 2014, AFPA members reduced their GHG emissions by 16%, surpassing the Better Practices, Better Planet 2020 goal of 15 % reduction. In 2017, wanting to further improve their performance, members launched a new goal to achieve a 20 % reduction of GHG emissions by 2020 from the 2005 baseline. Company-wide, Resolute evaluate on an ongoing basis the potential projects that could lead to additional GHG reductions, and continue investing in such capital projects. We also invest in energy efficiency projects and technologies to reduce our energy costs and emissions (both scope 1 and 2).

We have a long record of being proactive on the matter of climate change, as demonstrated by our 63.7 percent absolute reduction in GHG emissions from our operations through 2018, from a 2002 baseline. This ambitious reduction currently aligns with the concept of science-based goal setting, in that it far exceeds the reductions called for to date in the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). Building on that tradition, our 2025 GHG emissions goals aims to assure that GHG emissions are at least 50 percent below our 2002 baseline while still growing our business. We are committed to innovate to decarbonize industry, accelerate climate solutions, and reduce our own environmental footprint. This commitment was launched through our Strategic Sustainability Framework (Science for Circular, Science for Climate, and Science for Community), on Investor Day 2018, by 3M's Chief Executive Officer, and is rooted in our ambition to apply science for the greater good. As a science-based company, 3M uses the World Resources Institute (WRI) / World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard to set GHG emission reduction targets. For this reason, we are incorporating the findings of the Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C, published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in setting our goals and actions.1 This report, prepared by 91 authors from 40 countries and based on over 6,000 scientific references, finds that limiting global warming to 1.5C (2.7F) above pre-industrial temperatures would require ''deep emissions reductions\" and ''rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society.\" Achieving this goal also would ''reduce challenging impacts on ecosystems, human health and well-being.\"";NA;NA;NA;10;0.3;2.17391304347826;2018;"2018-12-31";18340000;"C5.1 2019 S1, C5.1 2019 S2L";NA;NA;6650000;"C6 2019 S1, C6 2019 S2L";NA;NA;"-0za-7f-0zb-7f-0vk-0rec-0rcd-0rec-0rea-0rca-0rcd-5aa";"Base year emissions check: -0vk: stated base year emissions are 100% of calculated base year emissions (C5.1 2019 | TOTAL 18340000).; Organizational changes: Other: 0.55% increased in 2018, Change in methodology: 0.24% increased in 2017,  Other: 2.0% increased in 2017, Other: 12% increase in 2016, Divestment: 0% decrease in 2013,  Change in methodology: 2% decrease in 2013";"285-abs-S12L-2002-2025-1";"absolute"

All sectors in fact have specific targets. In particular. Areti,(the Company that distributes electricity): as previous years, various interventions have been carried out in 2018 and are expected before year 2022: i) reduction of physical losses in the distribution network due to change in HV (from 60 kV to 150 kV), MV (from 8.4 kV to 20 kV), LV (from 231 V to 400 V); ii) new transformer installation - MV/LV transformers with very low losses; variation in the MV network configuration. In all Group areas also LED system lighting will be installed. Moreover, the reduction of Scope 2 emissions include installation of LED lighting systems of the Rome public lighting grid. These and other measures will bring to a total reduction of 6,500 t of CO2 (in 2022) if compared to 2017 emissions.In the water sector, the water company Acea Ato2's Energy Efficiency Plan has a target of 6 GWh to 2022 in waste water treatment sector. This target will be achieved through several optimization activities of biological oxidisation process in wastewater plants. During 2018 some of these activities have been completed (Capoluogo Treatment Plant: 0.25 GWh; Cerquette Treatment Plant: 0.48 GWh; Ostia Treatment Plant: 0.53 GWh; Cobis Treatment Plant: 0.67 GWh).Moreover, the same Water company Acea Ato 2's Energy Efficiency Plan has a target of 2 GWh to 2022 in water pumping system. This target will be achieved through several activities of water leakage research and pressure management. During 2018 some of these activities have been already completed.Finally, also Acea Ambiente (Environment Area) carries out and plans efficiency measures both through the replacement of lamps with LED lamps and the introduction of inverter systems where they are missing (at the plants of San Vittore del Lazio, Terni, Aprilia and Orvieto)";NA;NA;"other (breakdown matches)";4;0;1.4;2018;"2018-12-31";398287;"C6 2018 S2L";NA;NA;369586;"C6 2019 S2L";NA;NA;"-0ca-0db-0vm-0vn-0td-0rce-0rbd-0rec-5aa";"Base year emissions check: -0vm: stated base year emissions are 100% of calculated base year emissions (C6 2018 | TOTAL 398287). -0vn: stated base year emissions are 100% of calculated base year emissions (CCDS 2018 | TOTAL 398287).; Found keyword(s): other; Organizational changes: Change in boundary: 0.2% increased in 2018,  Change in methodology: 8.2% decreased in 2018,  Other: 0.6% decreased in 2018";"313-abs-S2L-2017-2022-1";"absolute"

According to the target, by 2025 the company will reduce its Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 21 per cent (an absolute target) from the 2016 base year. In 2018 the Group sold an old printing facility located in Tampere which had been used as a rental property since 2013. The impact of the property on the overall Scope 2 emissions of the Group was so significant that its removal from the propertyportfolio reduced the combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions of the year under review by nearly half of the 2016 level, also taking into account the other actions taken in 2018 to reduce emissions. The Group's combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in 2018 were 2,720 CO2e tonnes (Scope 2 emissions calculated by using the market based method.). In the reporting for 2018 Alma Media uses these figures, which reflect the impact of the sold printing facility. For 2019, the Group will recalculate its reference values for greenhouse gas emissions for the baseline year of 2016 to eliminate the effect of the printing facility sold by the Group. Subsequent reporting will be based on adjusted figures. Alma Media's science-based Scope 1 and 2 target covers GHG emissions caused by the use of electricity, district heating and district cooling in all Alma Media's properties, and the GHG emissions caused by Alma Media's leased cars. The emissions caused by distributing Alma Media's newspapers have been reported as part of Alma Media's Scope 3 emissions.Alma Media's science based Scope 1 and 2 target has been calculated in such a way that the emissions trajectory goes from the base year of 2016 until 2050. Therefore, after the company reaches its present Scope 1 and 2 target, it can formulate a new target based on the calculation done for SBTi. The Scope 1 and 2 emissions for the 2016 base year reported here have been corrected retroactively during the 2018 reporting.

Invest in onsite renewable energy - in our case that means Solar PV. We currently have ca 635kWhs installed capacity across 21 stores. All new built stores will have Solar PV installations of ca 50kWh and potentially a range of other technologies, such as ground source heat pumps / air source pumps to further reduce our carbon footprint.More recently, we have also started to explore options on how to help first our employees, now our customers to reduce their footprint: 1 store (Oxford ) offers an Electic Vehicle Charging pod; Manchester had a pod fitted in May 2019 and the next 4 store developments all include EV charging pods by design.Please refer to our Basis of Reporting document for full description ofscope, boundaries etc.";NA;NA;"Oxford (breakdown matches)";39;0.179487179487179;2.05128205128205;2019;"2019-03-31";6880;"C5.1 2019 S1, C5.1 2019 S2L";NA;NA;2853.9;"C6 2019 S1, C6 2019 S2L";NA;NA;"-0e-0fa-0fa-0e-0vk-0vo-0tc-0rbd-0reb-0rcb-0rcb-0rcb-0rcd-0rcb-0rcb-5aa";"Base year emissions check: -0vk: stated base year emissions are 100% of calculated base year emissions (C5.1 2019 | TOTAL 6880). -0vo: stated base year emissions are 108% of calculated base year emissions (DWH 2013 | TOTAL 7452).; Found keyword(s): Oxford; Organizational changes: Change in methodology: 5.4% decreased in 2018, Other: 14.05% decreased in 2017,  Acquisitions: 2.22% increased in 2017, Acquisitions: 0.9% increase in 2016, Acquisitions: 1.2% increase in 2014, Change in methodology: 0% decrease in 2013,  Acquisitions: 1% increase in 2013, Acquisitions: 3% increase in 2012";"1823-abs-S12L-2011-2050-1";"absolute"

In 2018, total emissions in our production network amounted to 962.545 tonnes of CO2, a 24% decrease in overall CO2 emissions when compared to 2015 (marked based calculation for Scope2 emissions). This means that we already achieved our 2020 target. Increase of energy efficiency was one key factor. Our target is to reduce energy consumption per vehicle produced by 45% between 2006 and 2020. By 2018 we achieved a 38% reduction. Supply of energy from renewable sources was another key element. In 2018 we purchased for vehicle production about 1,600 GWh of electricity, heat and cooling from renewable sources, among other things via certificates of origin. All European production sites are delivered with green electricity. In Spartanburg (USA) we replaced around 50% of our natural gas needs by utilizing landfill gas. In the next years we want to continue to expand electricity supply from renewable sources at our plants outside of Europe.

Since Abs1 as well as the renewable energy target in C4.2 are interim targets to achieve Abs2, measures in 2018 are the same as described there. Procedure: On the way to 100% renewable energy supply of our locations BMW Group takes a holistic approach. Top priority is given to systematic reduction of energy consumption, as energy savings are always the best alternative, both for the environment and for our business. To cover the remaining energy requirements, we are expanding our own renewable energy generation systems and are increasingly drawing power from local renewable sources. The renewable energy target in C4.2 addresses only CO2-emissions from purchased electricity. Abs1 includes also emissions from heat supply as well as from fuel combustion inside the BMW Group. On a mid to long-term perspective we see the potential to replace in an economically reasonable way fossil fuels by renewable fuels (e.g. biogas) and are doing this e.g. in Spartanburg (USA) with landfill gas. Scope of target: The emissions in Scope include all BMW Group locations including the Joint Venture locations in China. It excludes emissions from company owned vehicles and airplanes. From the 2015 emissions figures we get as percentage of emissions in scope 94%. Remark: To calculate the % of emissions in scope we included in the denominator emissions from company owned cars and planes since these are BMW Group Scope 1 & Scope 2 emissions.

Thus, all the entities have a ''CO2 savings\" target to reach, and a specific roadmap. This trajectory is broken down into annual CO2 targets to be avoided by 1.5% per year at Bouygues Construction Group level.

In this context, and in order to set the level of ambition of the efforts to be made by the businesses, reduction projections were made on the basis of climate scenarios and trajectories. The overall objective is to scope 1, 2, 3 upstream and aims to reduce the Group's carbon footprint by 20% by 2030, a reduction of 1.5% per year. This objective was determined as follows:- on scopes 1 and 2 the trajectory of factor 4 has been applied.- on scope 3 was considered a reduction of 1% per year.The scenario was chosen based on factor 4 as it is in line with the climate commitments of the public and private sector, namely that it is set on a path to limit global warming to 2 C.

Based on those new initiatives, and other energy saving programs implemented previously by Broadridge, in late 2014 Broadridge decided to make a voluntary commitment to reduce GHG emissions and emissions intensity. The details of that GHG reduction target commitment are as follows: by the end of 2020, Broadridge will reduce its Scope 1 + Scope 2 emissions total by 7.5% from its 2013 baseline emissions level, on an absolute GHG emissions basis. Also by the end of 2020, Broadridge will reduce its Scope 1 + Scope 2 total GHG emissions intensity by 30% from its 2013 baseline emissions levels, on an intensity basis of total Scope 1 + Scope 2 GHG emissions per $ Million of revenue. After the first six (6) years of this seven (7) year target commitment program, Broadridge's performance progress as of this 2019 CDP report has achieved the absolute GHG emissions reduction target commitment ahead of schedule, with an absolute emissions reduction of 24.2% from 2013 to 2019. This target's early achivement was due primarily to implementation of numerous energy efficiency and energy use reduction projects over the last 6 years; corporate streamlining/operational efficiency improvements from consolidating major printing operations after a large acquisition made at the beginning of 2017; and closing a captive Broadridge data center in FY2018 and shifting those operations to an existing contracted data host. Based on this performance success, in FY2020 Broadridge will be evaluating options for setting a new, long-term GHG emissions reduction target, as part of its expanding program for climate change and carbon management. (Note: While the relative, \"greening\" of the U.S. electrical grid during this time period, due to the displacement of coal by natural gas for power generation, has contributed somewhat to these GHG emissions reductions overall, Broadridge's corporate-wide electricity usage has decreased by 23% over the entire target commitment period - - despite 29% growth in total corporate revenues contemporaneously.)";NA;NA;NA;6;0.666666666666667;1.07142857142857;2019;"2019-04-30";73288;"C5.1 2019 S1, C5.1 2019 S2L";NA;NA;55529;"C6 2019 S1, C6 2019 S2L";NA;NA;"-0ca-0fa-0fb-0fa-0fb-0fb-0da-0db-0za-7f-0zb-7f-0vk-0waoq-0reb-0reb-5aa";"Base year emissions check: -0vk: stated base year emissions are 100% of calculated base year emissions (C5.1 2019 | TOTAL 73288). -0waoq: stated base year emissions are 48% higher than calculated base year emissions (DWH 2013 | TOTAL 49611).; Organizational changes: Other: 7.9% decreased in 2018, Other: 17.7% decreased in 2017";"2326-abs-S12L-2013-2020-1";"absolute"

The mid-term targets for CO2 emissions reduction, which were recognized as science-based targets this time, were set based on the view that worsening worldwide climate change is a serious social challenge and a business risk for the Brother Group that need to be addressed continuously for years. The Group's reduction targets have been expanded to include CO2 emissions from its value chain that account for more than 90% of its total CO2 emissions (Scope 3) in addition to CO2 emissions from office activities (Scope1 and 2), which the Group has already been addressing. Focusing on these scopes, the Brother Group contributes to preventing climate change.

CCR NovaDutra, CCR ViaOeste, CCR RodoNorte, CCR SPVias and CCR AutoBAn business units had the Group's highest revenue and, together, they met this criterion. The target year established was 2027 (as this is a target based on financial years, the year that applies the end of our financial year is 2027). At that time CCR Group's Scope 1 emissions corresponded to 30671.0 tCO2e while Scope 1 emissions of these units totalized 16876.0 tCO2e (16876.0/30671.0*100= 55%) and at that time Scope 2 emissions corresponded to 6573.0 tCO2e while Scope 2 emissions of these units totalled 2042.0 tCO2e (2042.0/6573.0*100=31%), resulting of 86% of emissions in scope. CCR Group's Scope 2 emissions at the time came only from the acquisition of electricity from distribution companies. In order to mitigate eventual variations due to changes in the composition of Brazil's National Interconnected System (SIN) for the distribution of electricity, business units should assess the performance of this goal in kWh consumed. The percentage of this target is completed in emissions is 77%.

CCR NovaDutra, CCR ViaOeste, CCR RodoNorte, CCR SPVias and CCR AutoBAn business units had the Group's highest revenue and, together, they met this criterion. The target year established was 2034 (as this is a target based on financial years, the year that applies the end of our financial year is 2034). At that time CCR Group's Scope 1 emissions corresponded to 30671.0 tCO2e while Scope 1 emissions of these units totalled 16876.0 tCO2e (16876.0/30671.0*100= 55%) and at that time Scope 2 emissions corresponded to 6573.0 tCO2e while Scope 2 emissions of these units totalized 2042.0 tCO2e (2042.0/6573.0*100= 31%), resulting of 86% of emissions in scope. CCR Group's Scope 2 emissions at the time came only from the acquisition of electricity from distribution companies. In order to mitigate eventual variations due to changes in the composition of Brazil's National Interconnected System (SIN) for the distribution of electricity, business units should assess the performance of this goal in kWh consumed. The percentage of this target is completed in emissions is 61%. Calculation: [(23.1/38)*100=61%], considering the target of reducing business units' Scope 1 and 2 (location based) GHG emissions by 38% by 2034 compared with a 2012 target base year and considering the reporting year 2017, where the emissions`s Scope I and II had already reduced 23.1% compared to the emissions from the target base year. Calculation: [14554.97 tCO2e (sum of this business units Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions obtained in the report year) - 18799.0 tCO2e (sum of business units Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions obtained in the base year) = 4363.12 tCO2e.] Calculation: [(4363.12 /18918.0)*100 = 23.1%.] *The figure provided is not considering the amount of emissions from the land-use change category.

It was developed in 2016, from the review of the material themes of Duratex that resulted in the company's Sustainability Strategy, to start in 2017. This target only covers Duratex's operations in Brazil, excluding Ceusa (a ceramic company acquired in 2017, after the definition of the annual milestones that arised from the targets). In 2012, Duratex's capital participation in Tablemac (now called Duratex Colombia) increased from 25% to 37%, and their emissions were not yet accounted for, which is why the Scopes emissions percentage was 100% in the base year. In, 2018, the operations covered in the target would represent 73.26% of direct emissions.Duratexs Sustainability Strategy review should occur every 3 years. Currently, the Strategy and its targets are under review. The expected evolution to reach the target in 2025 was not linear, since variable production projections were taken into account. Considering the projections made at the time of the milestones elaboration, the emissions from Duratex's Brazilian operations in 2018, which include the Deca (Metals and Ceramics), Hydra and Wood (Forest and Panels) divisions, totaled 132,888.64 tCO2e, which are lower compared to the milestone expected for 2018 (178,562.77 tCO2e), and also inferior to 75% of the baseline.

The calculation of our emission reduction targets is based on the core policy scenario EUCO30. Moreover, we assume an improvement of energy efficiency and gas pipelines leading to a reduction on Scope 1 emissions by 1% annually and a 1% reduction of transmission and distribution losses of Scope 2 emissions. Scope 3 emissions will be reduced by increasing the share of renewable energy purchased and increasing the share of own generation of electricity from renewable energy sources. Under 2018 we released a new energy efficiency project: ''All E.ON premises carbon-neutral by 2030\". We updated the target to 2030 in order to be in line with the SDG timeframe and our climate strategy.Our direct and indirect carbon emissions totalled 69.06 million tonnes of CO2e in 2018, what represents a decline compared to previous year. This was mainly due to the lower Scope 3 emissions. Lower purchasing volumes, the purchase of less carbon-intensive materials and lower sales volumes of electricity and gas led to reductions and update emissions factors (e.g. for national grid factors and natural gas)2016 marked the starting point of measures and initiatives that will help us achieve our new climate-protection targets for 2030. However, year-on-year comparisons can be affected by fluctuations. A period of several years is necessary to determine whether our measures are effective and where we stand with regard to our targets.

On July 27, 2015, Google committed to tripling our purchases of renewables (then 1.1GW) by 2025 (see: https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/07/27/fact-sheet-white-house-launches-american-business-act-climate-pledge). This was expected to result in installed production capacity of 3.4GW of renewable power and an annual GHG emissions reduction of approximately 2.7 million tCO2 by 2025, of which an increase of 1.8 million tCO2 in our annual GHG emissions reduction (from 0.9 million tCO2/year to 2.7 million tCO2/year) will be achieved by 2025.As of December 31, 2018, we exceeded this target seven years early: since 2010, we've signed 34 agreements totaling 3.75 gigawatts of renewable energy (see target RE2). As of the end of 2018, our annual greenhouse gas emissions reductions from our renewable energy projects were 3.6 million metric tons, which puts us 202% of the way towards this goal from an emissions reduction perspective, and 115% of the way towards this goal from a renewable energy perspective. Our calculations assume that the grid emissions factors in the target year remain the same.Our overall energy usage from base year to target year is expected to increase, so this target is expected to result in an equivalent annual reduction of emissions from base year to target year of 124% by 2025, though we have written 100% as that is the maximum value possible for this field. Our % reduction from base year represents annual emissions reductions in our target year due to additional purchases of renewables (1.8 million tCO2), as compared to our annual base year emissions covered by this target (1.5 million tCO2). [(1.8 million tCO2/1.5 million tCO2)*100 = 124%].

In 2012, we set a longterm goal to purchase enough renewable energy to match all the electricity we consume globally on an annual basis. In 2017, and again in 2018, we achieved it: Google's total purchase of energy from sources like wind and solar exceeded the amount of electricity used by our operations around the world, including offices and data centers. While we're still drawing power from the grid, some of which is from fossil fuel resources, we're purchasing enough wind and solar energy to match every MWh of electricity our data center and office operations consume annually.In 2018, our annual GHG reductions from our renewable energy projects were 3.6 million metric tons. This puts us 202% of the way towards this goal from an emissions reduction perspective. Google is the largest cumulative corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the world. Since 2010, we've signed 34 agreements totaling 3.75 gigawatts of renewable energy.Reaching our 100% renewable purchasing goal means that Google buys on an annual basis the same amount of megawatt-hours (MWh) of renewable energy-both the physical energy and its corresponding renewable energy certificates (RECs)-as the amount of MWh of electricity that we consume for our operations around the world. Where possible, we buy this energy directly from our utility providers and from green energy facilities in the same grid regions as our data centers.Since we're using Abs2 as our interim target for Abs3 and it would be difficult to predict our emissions in 2040, we used most of the same data here for Abs3 as we did for Abs2. We know we will increase our annual GHG emissions reduction by at least 1.8 million tCO2 of emissions (our Abs2 target) sometime before 2040. The actual reduction in tCO2 will likely be greater as we believe our Scope 2 emissions will grow between our base year and 2040.Matching 100% renewable energy is just the beginning. We're building new data centers and offices, and as demand for Google products grows, so does our electricity load. We need to be constantly adding renewables to our portfolio to keep up. So we'll keep signing contracts to buy more renewable energy. And in those regions where we can't yet buy renewables, we'll keep working on ways to help open the market.

This target has not formally been approved by the SBTi. However, since it covers all our value chain emissions and it has an ambition level that goes beyond SBTi (to become climate positive) we consider it to be science-based.With the help of expert scientific organizations and the WWF Climate Savers, we have taken a science-based approach to establish three key priorities to help us reach this goal. Priority 1 focuses on leadership in energy efficiency to enable us to use as little energy as possible. Priority 2 tackles our 100% renewable energy goal which will help us to ensure that the energy we use is renewable. Priority 3 targets climate resilience and carbon sinks, to address unavoidable emissions and emissions beyond what our value chain is responsible for. These three priorities relate to emissions in both our own operations and those across our value chain.We are committed to fully eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from our own operations. However, despite our best efforts, we recognise that there will still be unavoidable emissions in our value chain. To truly become climate positive, we are engaging in activities to absorb emissions both within and beyond our direct control. This involves actively supporting mechanisms that reduce existing emissions while strengthening climate resilience. We need to further develop this approach and collaborate with experts to move solutions forward. Currently, we are exploring opportunities in 3 areas: 1. Natural carbon sinks - these are nature's existing mechanisms for absorbing greenhouse gases. This area could include protecting valuable biomass (such as rainforests) or investments in more sustainable agriculture. 2. Technological carbon sinks - these are technological innovations that are designed to absorb existing greenhouse gases and turn them into new products and materials. 3. Reductions outside our value chain - these are engagement activities that reduce greenhouse gases coming from sources unrelated to our value chain. Only accounting for energy efficiency initiatives in the Supply chain, our reduction efforts have contributed to a reduction of 183 296 tonnes of CO2. This represents 1% of total emissions across the value chain.";NA;NA;NA;23;0.0434782608695652;4.16666666666667;2018;"2018-11-30";16980221.5;"DWH 2017 S1, DWH 2017 S2M, DWH 2017 S3.01, DWH 2017 S3.02, DWH 2017 S3.03, DWH 2017 S3.04, DWH 2017 S3.05, DWH 2017 S3.06, DWH 2017 S3.07, DWH 2017 S3.08, DWH 2017 S3.09, DWH 2017 S3.10, DWH 2017 S3.11, DWH 2017 S3.12, DWH 2017 S3.13, DWH 2017 S3.14, DWH 2017 S3.15, DWH 2017 S3.16, DWH 2017 S3.17: upstream completeness: 1 downstream completeness: 1";80651.5;"CCDS 2017 S1, CCDS 2017 S2M";18444545;"C6 2019 S1, C6 2019 S2M, C6 2019 S3.01, C6 2019 S3.02, C6 2019 S3.03, C6 2019 S3.04, C6 2019 S3.05, C6 2019 S3.06, C6 2019 S3.07, C6 2019 S3.08, C6 2019 S3.09, C6 2019 S3.10, C6 2019 S3.11, C6 2019 S3.12, C6 2019 S3.13, C6 2019 S3.14, C6 2019 S3.15: upstream completeness: 1 downstream completeness: 1";56978;"C6 2019 S1, C6 2019 S2M";"-0e-0fa-0cd-0zb-7f-0sa-0vo-5aa";"Base year emissions check: Base yr emissions for target scope, Scope 1+2 (market-based) +3 (upstream & downstream), has been calculated from the following scopes/categories: S1, S2M, S3.01, S3.02, S3.03, S3.04, S3.05, S3.06, S3.07, S3.08, S3.09, S3.10, S3.11, S3.12, S3.13, S3.14, S3.15, S3.16, S3.17 (upstream completeness: 1 downstream completeness: 1). -0vo: stated base year emissions are 93% of calculated base year emissions (DWH 2017 | TOTAL 16980221.5).";"7903-abs-S12M3-2016-2040-1";"absolute"

This is following the available South African Integrated Resource Plan (IRP) on electricity. The IRP sets out to reduce the country's grid emission factor from 1.01tCO2e/MWh in 2015 to a value of 0.789tCO2e/MWh in 2025. This is based on the latest, available version of the IRP, and follows the Policy Adjusted Plan. In line with this Harmony agrees to reduce its South African scope 2 emissions by 22% over a 10-year period, assuming its operations remain grid connected, and electricity consumption remains constant. This is an annual reduction in emissions of 2.2%. In addition to the trajectory of the grid emission factor, Harmony may implement additional mitigation actions to further reduce its scope 2 emissions in order to reach this target. The IRP's projections considers the South African global commitment which was submitted to the UN in December 2015 as part of its Nationally Determined Contribution, which is the Peak, Plateau and Decline trajectory for the country. This target accounts for 100% of the emissions in the scope as the scope 2 emissions in Papua New Guinea are zero due to the country's predominantly hydro-powered electricity grid. In addition, Harmony is currently participating in the development of a new Science Based Target methodology, through which a science based target will be set in the near future for the company.

In March 2018, IBK prepared a report on GHG emissions for 2017 and reported it to the government. In August 2018, IBK received GHG reduction target for 2019 through consultation with the government. The Ministry of Land Transport and Marine Affairs has given the IBK annual GHG reduction targets since 2017. The criteria for GHG reduction targets are based on the ''National 2020 GHG reduction roadmap\". THe MRV procedure was performed according to the regulation. IBK's reduction efforts in 2018 produced 61,300 tonnes, 9.76% less than the permissible emission of 67,937 tonnes. IBK's emissions by 2018 are 61,300.44 tons. the government has allocated an emission allowance of 67,937 tonnes based on IBK's 2018 BAU projected emissions. IBK, on the other hand, produced 61,300.44 tons in 2018 in an effort to reduce GHG emissions. The reduction rate is 9.76%. Government reduction targets are provided annually. In 2030, the rate of government building reduction was 18.1% of BAU emissions.

We achieved a 21% reduction in 2018, exceeding our Vision 2020 goal, and will continue to evaluate and implement improvement projects.We operate more than 200 converting locations. Collectively, our converting operations emit approximately 1.1 million metric tons of GHG. Over time, emissions from our converting facilities have trended slightly downward by approximately 11 percent since 2010. Emissions from transporting product to converters are considered Scope 3 emissions and are not included in our reported GHG emissions. Our reported emissions do not include biogenic GHG emissions, which were 33.7 million metric tons in 2018. Through continuous improvements in operations, equipment, energy efficiency and fuel diversity, we were able to achieve significant company-wide GHG emission reductions. We have expanded our business while running with greater efficiency as shown by our energy efficiency improvement of 8.9% over 2010. Moreover, we have achieved a 46% decrease in other air emissions from our baseline year. This decrease is driven by both our efficiency efforts, regulatory requirements, and fuel switching away from coal and fuel oil to natural gas and biomass. We will continue to work with partners and increase efforts to reduce our emissions globally.We use the GHG Protocol for Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standards to inform our GHG goal accounting and reporting. Our emissions calculations for our current goal are global, and do not include joint ventures with non-operational control, biogenic CO2, or any acquisitions or divestitures that occurred during the reporting year. Baseline emission data recalculations are made annually to incorporate acquired facilities and take out divested facilities, which accounts for changes in emissions data reporting from year to this year. As such in 2018, as a result of the transfer of the North American Consumer Packaging Business, all current and prior year emissions data calculations have been adjusted to reflect this business as a discontinued operation.

It was developed in 2016, from the review of the material themes of Duratex that resulted in the company's Sustainability Strategy, to start in 2017. This target only covers Duratex's operations in Brazil, excluding Ceusa (a ceramic company acquired in 2017, after the definition of the annual milestones that arised from the targets). In 2012, Duratex's capital participation in Tablemac (now called Duratex Colombia) increased from 25% to 37%, and their emissions were not yet accounted for, which is why the Scopes emissions percentage was 100% in the base year. In, 2018, the operations covered in the target would represent 73.26% of direct emissions.Duratexs Sustainability Strategy review should occur every 3 years. Currently, the Strategy and its targets are under review. The expected evolution to reach the target in 2025 was not linear, since variable production projections were taken into account. Considering the projections made at the time of the milestones elaboration, the emissions from Duratex's Brazilian operations in 2018, which include the Deca (Metals and Ceramics), Hydra and Wood (Forest and Panels) divisions, totaled 132,888.64 tCO2e, which are lower compared to the milestone expected for 2018 (178,562.77 tCO2e), and also inferior to 75% of the baseline.

Kumba achieved these interim targets by saving 4.6% energy and 5.7% carbon on our BAU baseline. The 2015 targets were set as intermediate targets with the goal to firstly fully implement and embed the ECO2MAN program at all operations and then set further targets for 2020 to align with government commitments. In 2016, we have set new long-term targets for energy (extended to 11.7%) and GHGs (extended to 10.7%) reduction by 2020. These targets are aligned with the Anglo American process to resubmit more realistic targets for 2020. Emissions are projected based on circumstances in line with operating plans (stripping ratios, ore hardness, haul distances, expansions and closures, etc.) and then performance is measured, ex- post, in line with the World Resources Institute's (WRI) Policy and Action Standard. Improvements are achieved by selecting and implementing high value energy efficiency and GHG mitigating and include projects undertaken through operational improvements and supply chain procurement. This understanding formed the basis for setting our ambitious target to reduce GHG emissions by 10.7% against our adjusted 2020 baseline consumption (subject to divestments and significant business changes). ECO2MAN is supported by an Anglo American carbon and energy technical standard and related guidance. The Group is currently developing a Sustainability Strategy and, subject to management review, it may include longer-term (2030) aspirational energy- and carbon-reduction targets aligned with an end goal for a carbon-neutral mine.

In this framework, a new Green Move ambition, which covers the reduction of the environmental footprint of mobility aspects (business travels, car fleet and daily commute), has been set up. On business travel, reducing the environmental footprint of travels by plane is a key topic and involves several levers such as assessing the travel's carbon footprint from employees of all the subsidiaries with a shared Group's methodology or promoting IT-solutions as alternatives to business travels. Achieving this Group target relies on a global awareness of all the employees on the importance of the issue, as well as on an individual awareness. For individual awareness, employees having travelled at least once in the past three months now receive a personalized quarterly dashboard with their cumulated CO2 emissions.The percentage of target achieved (0%) at the end of 2018 is mainly explained by the Group's growth between 2016, which is the base-year of our SBT commitment, and 2018.

Yet, our Science Based Targets, submitted to SBTi, are towards 2030 and 2050, not 2020.1/ Explanation regarding 2020 objective set in 2016: Michelin's objective by 2020 is to lower CO2 emissions per metric ton of finished product by 32 percent compared with 2010. If production growth is 25 percent over the same period, then CO2 emissions will be reduced by 15 percent over the period. The actual % complete is 175% (100% was entered as the ORS system does not accept a higher value). The target is -15%, and the 2018 result is -26%, which is partly explained by the fact that the we anticipated our renewable electricity purchases necessary to reach the 2020 target, and partly because production growth has been lower than expected. Yet, if Michelin's production growth prediction for 2020 is met, which is still highly likely through on-going external acquisitions, the resulting reduction will be around -15%. This is why the target status is \"underway\" through 2020 when the final result will be known. Intermediate results cannot be considered as achieved because of the increase in production awaited from new acquisition.2/ On-going recalculation of base year emissions for SBT submission:As described in our 2015 registration document (p 178), the same emission factor was used until 2014 for all of the sites purchasing steam, regardless of the primary energy or technology used by the vendor.

GHG emissions for 2018/19 are around 1.4% higher than last year, primarily due to increased emissions from our US power generation business as a result of more deployment of our generation units. Though the dispatch is outside National Grid's control, the units are maintained to operate as efficiently and reliably as possible. National Grid utilises Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS) to monitor its generator emissions. We still continue to challenge each of our business units to make year on year reductions in emissions. National Grid is the electricity transmission owner and operator in the UK and parts of the North-eastern US. These systems have thermal losses (lost energy) resulting from the physical properties of the transmission cables. Losses from the transmission systems have previously been classified as Scope 3 indirect emissions. However, following guidance from the World Resources Institute these are now classified as Scope 2 emissions.";NA;NA;NA;42;0.238095238095238;1.33333333333333;2019;"2019-03-31";21630971;"C5.1 2018 S1, C5.1 2018 S2L";NA;NA;7012642;"C6 2019 S1, C6 2019 S2L";NA;NA;"-0fa-0fa-0fa-0za-7f-0zb-7f-0vk-0rec-0rcd-0rca-0rcd-0rec-0rec-0reb-0rec-5aa";"Base year emissions check: -0vk: stated base year emissions are 100% of calculated base year emissions (C5.1 2018 | TOTAL 21630971).; Organizational changes: Other: 0.14% increased in 2018,  Change in methodology: 0.0% decreased in 2018, Divestment: 0.0% decreased in 2017,  Change in methodology: 4.47% decreased in 2017,  Other: 0.55% decreased in 2017, Other: 3% decrease in 2016, Other: 5.4% decrease in 2015, Other: 1.81% increase in 2014";"12832-abs-S12L-1990-2050-1";"absolute"

The percentages presented here were calculated based on absolute emissions reduction compared to year 2000 as base year. We set our mid-term and long-term absolute targets for 2030 and 2050, respectively, starting from 2017.In the mid-term, Nissan will not be able to reach an average year-on-year reduction between 2017 and 2030 of at least 2.1%; on the contrary, a slight absolute emissions increase of 0.8% a year is expected to be observed for this period. However, according to our internal study, Nissan predicts that the penetration of its EVs will accelerate substantially in the long term, and absolute CO2 emissions will drop steeply from the mid-2030s. Indeed, the average year-on-year reduction between 2017 and 2050 is 2.12%, which means that the contribution of EVs is one of the most important aspects in our long-term goal of reducing absolute emissions according to our target.The percentages were calculated dividing the difference in emissions between start year and target year in relation to base year emissions.In 2008, Nissan realised that further reductions also in terms of intensity may be necessary as suggested by the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report. 450ppm represents the scenarios of Category I, and change in global CO2 emissions 2050 need to be half (50%) of 2000 which is re-calculated in WtW as -90% in 2050, which is an intensity target applied for new vehicles (in g-C02/km).In order to translate -50% absolute IPCC requirement to the WtW -90% intensity, the estimated 2050 vehicle volume shown in IEA's Mobility Model is adopted.

The percentages presented here were calculated based on absolute emissions reduction compared to year 2000 as base year. We set our mid-term and long-term absolute targets for 2030 and 2050, respectively, starting from 2017.In the mid-term, Nissan will not be able to reach an average year-on-year reduction between 2017 and 2030 of at least 2.1%; on the contrary, a slight absolute emissions increase of 0.8% a year is expected to be observed for this period. However, according to our internal study, Nissan predicts that the penetration of its EVs will accelerate substantially in the long term, and absolute CO2 emissions will drop steeply from the mid-2030s. Indeed, the average year-on-year reduction between 2017 and 2050 is 2.12%, which means that the contribution of EVs is one of the most important aspects in our long-term goal of reducing absolute emissions according to our target.The percentages were calculated dividing the difference in emissions between start year and target year in relation to base year emissions.In 2008, Nissan realised that further reductions also in terms of intensity may be necessary as suggested by the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report. 450ppm represents the scenarios of Category I, and change in global CO2 emissions 2050 need to be half (50%) of 2000 which is re-calculated in WtW as -90% in 2050, which is an intensity target applied for new vehicles (in g-C02/km).In order to translate -50% absolute IPCC requirement to the WtW -90% intensity, the estimated 2050 vehicle volume shown in IEA's Mobility Model is adopted.

Philips focuses on making products more ecologically efficient and reducing the environmental impact of its operations. This has lead Philips to form the Sustainable Operations program which focuses on improving the environmental performance of manufacturing facilities with relation to climate change, water, and waste and chemical substances. Globally, Philips is a member of the RE100, a collaborative initiative of influential businesses committed to 100 percent renewable electricity. Over the last 11 years (2007-2018), Philips has increased its use of renewable electricity from 8 percent to 90 percent.

We must achieve this target each year. Since the target must be met anew each year, we record base year emissions as 2018 emissions. We update the base year emissions each year. In 2018, our emissions were 21,300,000 MT, meaning our target was to enable at least 42,600,000 MT to be avoided. (21,300,000 MT CO2e * 2 = 42,600,000 MT CO2e). We calculated the carbon productivity of 5 signature products in 5 markets, including Hydrogen sold to make ultra-low sulfur fuel (used in vehicles with diesel particulate filters), Oxygen sold to optimize combustion in steelmaking, Krypton sold to insulate windows, Argon for welding, and specialty coatings to make thermal barriers for industrial gas turbine and jet engine efficiency. These markets contributed 11% of sales in 2018 and enabled customers to avoid 72 million metric tons CO2e in 2018, which means we met the target for 2018. Praxair does not calculate customer GHG emissions. So we express this target as 100% reduction of twice our 2018 emissions (Scope 1+2). % emissions in scope is 100, since the target is measured against our total Scope 1+2 footprint. This target is part of Praxair's 5-year sustainable development targets, which run 2016 to 2020. The target year is 2020 because we must achieve this target each of the 5 years.

We have established a 2015 baseline for our new absolute target, as pre-2015 data for our new business units is not available or is not relevant due to business changes. RB's absolute greenhouse gas emissions for scope 1 and 2 in 2018 were 396,070. This represents a 7% reduction in absolute terms since 2015. This means that we have are 11% towards achieving our 2030 target [423,656-396,070 = 27,586 CO2et; - 27,586 /423,656*100 = -7%; % of target achieved: 7%/60%=11%]. These greenhouse gas emissions are reported based on a market-based approach. Please note we are in the process of reviewing our 2015 baseline data to integrate pre-acquisition data for our IFCN business, therefore our 2015 baseline maybe subject to recalculation following completion of our review and our IFCN baseline data set is confirmed.Status: Target on track - greenhouse gas emission reductions are on track to be achieved before the target year, based on progress so far.";NA;NA;NA;12;0;4;2018;"2018-12-31";NA;NA;NA;NA;396070;"C6 2019 S1, C6 2019 S2M";NA;NA;"-0e-0fa-0fa-0fa-0fa-0e-0fa-0rab-0rca-0rcb-0rcd-0rba-0reb-0rca-5ad";"Organizational changes: Acquisitions: 54.0% increased in 2018,  Divestment: 4.0% decreased in 2018, Acquisitions: 2.2% increased in 2017,  Change in methodology: 1.1% increased in 2017,  Divestment: 7.7% decreased in 2017, Other: 8.9% decrease in 2016,  Divestment: 0.19% decrease in 2016";"15591-abs-S12M-2015-2030-1";"absolute"

Offsetting operational emissions is not enough. We're taking a bold position to leverage innovation and lead the industry in combating climate change. Landfill methane emissions, vehicle and equipment emissions, and building electricity all contribute to climate change. That's why we've adopted an aggressive target for reducing our operational GHG emissions, approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and aligned with the UN ''Climate Action\" SDG 13.2 - reduce greenhouse gas emissions.Goal: Reduce absolute total Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions 35% by 2030.Simply put, our ambitious target reduction in greenhouse gas emissions is designed to keep the global temperature increase well below 2C. However, the path we'll take to achieve this goal is anything but simple.How We'll Get There1. Reducing Emissions Through Landfill InnovationFugitive emissions are approximately 50% methane - a recognized greenhouse gas. Highly efficient landfills such as ours collect most of this gas for beneficial reuse or processing, turning an impact into an opportunity. However, to further manage our fugitive emissions and meet our goal, we'll be looking at new technology and operating practices while ensuring that landfills remain stable and secure for decades to come.2. Reducing Fleet EmissionsIn 2018 we announced a partnership with Mack(R) Trucks to build and operate a fully electric Mack LR collection truck to help us achieve our ambitious emissions goal. But there are also unique challenges including battery size, weight and recharge time. We believe electrification of our fleet is the future and look forward to learning more when our Mack pilot hits the road in early 2020. We're leveraging renewable natural gas as a bridging strategy from diesel to electric, as it provides the maximum possible reductions in fleet emissions attainable today.3. Reducing Emissions When We BuildOur new building construction and retrofits adhere to the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards.

The primary step in reducing CO2 emissions is to reduce the energy consumption (trias energetica). We have an ambition to reduce our energy consumption with 55% in 2030 compared to our baseyear. We are currently in the process of re-assessing the impact of our updated growth strategy and introduction of new network technology on our energy consumption (see page 68 Annual Report 2018, https://jaarverslag2018.kpn/).While datacommunication and the use of our ICT services are growing exponentially (on average 45% each year) KPN's energy consumption has decreased with 24% compared to baseyear 2010 (see page 72 Annual Report 2018).Target progress is measured in gross scope 1 en scope 2 location based emissions. More than 98% of our scope 1 & 2 CO2e emissions are in scope (result of our materiality assessment) Result2018 emissions are 337,500 ton. Compared to baseyear 2010 (429,183 ton) this is a 21.4% reduction. So % completion against target is 21.4/55 = 39%.

We now take into account all offsetting, including the offsetting for gas consumption. This was excluded in previous years.Note 3:In CDP2018 we reported for % achieved 55% for this target. This percentage had to be 29% achieved. Due to the changes in this question in CDP2018 we presented 55%. So the actual % achieved is increased from 29% to 39%. Note 4:On a like for like basis (emission reporting 2017 fully equal to emission reporting method 2018) the % achieved in CDP2018 (for 2017) would have been 41%. So to give the correct impression the % achieved is decreased with 2% (from 41% to 39%).

This target is approved by SBTi on 13th February 2017. The SBTi technical team and the SBTi Steering Committee have approved the submitted target on reduction of gross scope 1 emissions. This target is part of our approved science based target to have zero gross Scope1 emissions and zero scope 2 market based emissions as from 2030.

It is designed to capture, transport and store over one million tonnes of CO2 annually.Shell operates the Quest CCS project (Shell interest 10%) which captures and stores CO2 from the Scotford Upgrader.The target year 2025 is based on a 10-year contract starting at the time of the project launch in 2015. We have put 100% of target achieved as the facility is storing over one million tonnes of CO2 annually.Quest has a robust measurement, monitoring and verification programme verified by a third party (Det Norske Veritas (DNV)) to ensure the CO2 is permanently stored.As of May 23rd, 2019, in less than four years of operation, the Quest CCS facility has captured and safely stored about four million tonnes of CO2, ahead of schedule and at a lower cost than anticipated. Four million tonnes of CO2 are equal to the annual emissions from about one million cars. By May 2019, Quest had stored underground the most CO2 of any onshore CCS facility in the world with dedicated geological storage.https://www.shell.ca/en_ca/media/news-and-media-releases/news-releases-2019/quest-ccs-facility-reaches-major-milestone.html";NA;NA;"Canada (breakdown matches); annual";10;0.3;2.27272727272727;2018;"2018-12-31";76000000;"DWH 2015 S1";NA;NA;71000000;"C6 2019 S1";NA;NA;"-0ca-0ma-0fa-0fb-0za-7f-0zb-7f-0wboq-0ta-0rcd-0rcb-0rec-0rce-0rca-0rce-0rca-0rcb-0rcd-0rec-0rab-0rca-0rec-0rce-0rcd-0rec-0rcb-0rce-0rcd-0rca-5ad";"Base year emissions check: -0wboq: stated base year emissions are 11% lower than calculated base year emissions (DWH 2015 | TOTAL 3800000).; Found keyword(s): Canada; Organizational changes: Change in methodology: 0.7% decreased in 2018,  Acquisitions: 1.7% increased in 2018,  Other: 1.0% increased in 2018,  Change in boundary: 1.4% decreased in 2018,  Divestment: 4.4% decreased in 2018, Change in boundary: 1.8% decreased in 2017,  Divestment: 2.4% decreased in 2017,  Acquisitions: 4.1% increased in 2017,  Change in methodology: 0.2% decreased in 2017,  Other: 2.4% increased in 2017, Acquisitions: 8.6% increase in 2016,  Divestment: 1.2% decrease in 2016,  Other: 0.6% increase in 2016,  Change in boundary: 0.02% decrease in 2016,  Change in methodology: 0.3% decrease in 2016, Other: 1.6% decrease in 2015,  Acquisitions: 0.1% increase in 2015,  Change in boundary: 0.4% decrease in 2015,  Change in methodology: 0.1% increase in 2015,  Divestment: 2.8% decrease in 2015";"16012-abs-S1-2014-2025-1";"absolute"

According to the current lignite roadmap, the path for lignite until 2030 for Germany is given (a decision still has to be made on how this roadmap can be adjusted in detail on the basis of the statutory implementation of the recommendations of the Commission ''Growth, Structural Change and Employment\"). The here presented target is based on the current lignite roadmap. The reduction target given above is up to 50% until 2030. According to the current lignite roadmap, electricity generation from lignite and therefore the associated emissions will have ceased entirely by the middle of the cen-tury.In detail: By 2020 compared to base year, we will have reduced our emissions produced in the generation of electricity from lignite by around 15% as a result of so-called security standby. Emissions will continue to fall up to 2030 owing to the decline in the number of operational hours in the wake of expanding renewable energy, efficiency enhancements, additional modernisation of our power plant portfolio and by discontinuation of the Inden opencast mine and the associated shutdown of the Weisweiler lignite-fired power plant. The resultant fall in emissions by 2030 will then be a total of up to 50%.With regard to hard coal we anticipate further CO2 reductions in our power plant portfolio. This results by the shutdown of our Gersteinwerk power station (beginning of 2019). In the Netherlands we are partly replacing hard coal for firing our power plants with biomass. Starting in 2020, this will enable us to increase the proportion of biomass at the Amer 9 power plant by as much as 80%.

FMS shops represent 71% of the Ryder portfolio facility count. FMS 2009 Scope 1 and 2 emissions represent 15% of the total 2009 Scope 1 and 2 emissions. In 2012, Ryder launched a pilot energy challenge for high energy use locations. Then in 2013, the Resource Conservation Program (RCP) was initiated to target FMS, SCS and Admin locations across the US and Canada. Currently we are expanding internal processes to facilitate emission reduction projects on a larger strategic scale for all owned sites being upgraded or newly constructed. A primary goal is to identify best practices for electricity and natural gas reductions. The RCP framework includes three program keystones that will help managers reduce energy, water, sewer, and waste costs. The first keystone is designed to implement resource saving programs; the second keystone will make resource use more efficient in operations and processes while the third keystone will prepare for future business needs. The program encourages behavioral changes through employee engagement and energy champions. No/Low cost changes are continually reviewed to encourage energy savings such as efficient shop lighting. Shop Managers are constantly encouraged to adopt routine repair and maintenance programs, and utility energy audits are regularly conducted. Employees are provided checklists and guidelines to stay current on energy saving measures including but not limited to: temperature control for HVAC and appliances, lighting management tips, and equipment maintenance. The tools are distributed at monthly meetings, dedicated energy conservation websites and targeted email roll-outs. Several campaigns have been designed to focus on seasonal energy management improvements. Dashboards are provided to locations with current energy use. Energy efficiency education increased by providing state and utility guidelines including rebate programs, allowing improved tracking, and creating energy webinars and educational materials to reduce energy use.

Originally set as a 53% reduction in 2050 vs 2015, in 2017 we have updated our target to a 60% reduction in 2050 vs 2017 to be in line with our new Schneider Sustainability Impact 2018-2020.Following the publication of IPCC's SR15 Report, in 2019 we have submitted a new target that was validated by the SBTi, with an increased ambition to achieve -65% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030, and a -35% emissions from scope 3 within the same period, in line with 1.5C required levels of ambition.During this work, we have completed the calculation of 100% of our carbon footprint for all scopes in particular by:- including emissions from our company fleet in scope 1 (previously reported but in scope 3)- estimating scope 1 and 2 emissions from sites out of our environmental reporting scope (the scope of environmental reporting is that of ISO 14001 certified sites, and certain non-certified sites on a voluntary basis and without interruption in time. All of the industrial and logistics sites with more than 50 people and the major tertiary sites with more than 500 people must be ISO 14001 certified within 2 years after their acquisition or creation. The scope of environmental reporting covers about 78% of the Group headcount).- estimating emissions from the use of our products, as our products consume electricity and dissipate heat (Joule effect) during use phase. Nevertheless, it is important to note that our products are part of larger electricity architectures, which lead to two essential considerations:- the energy consumed by our products is mostly negligible with respect to the architecture in which they are installed- the architecture often enables to deliver efficiency through energy management and automation (see more details in scope 3 target).This target is the Scope 1+2 part of our 1.5C SBT.In 2018 our Scope 1 and 2 emissions equaled 555,266 tCO2e, a 19% reduction vs 2017 in absolute terms ([555,266 / 687,127 - 1] x 100 = -19,2).

Target performance: SSE's behaviour change programme, Better Off, aims to engage employees on energy efficiency activities, and SSE has invested 12.3m since 2011/12 on energy efficiency and renewable technologies in its buildings and depots. During 2018/19, investments included a 200,000 investment in solar photovoltaic installations at our Perth Campus and various depot sites throughout our estate, resulting in an estimated emissions reduction of almost 200 tCO2, and building energy management systems across multiple sites.

Electricity consumption reduced by 13% between 2017/18 and 2018/19 and gas usage for the same period dropped by 5% as a result of improved building operation and utilisation.This is a science-based target.

This is significant progress towards our intended target of a 15% reduction and a demonstration of our commitment towards effectively managing our use of energy. We are continuously improving our transition to a low-carbon economy, migrating from an energy intensity-based target calculation methodology to one that is carbon-based. In 2018 we decided to pursue a science-based target (SBT) on our direct emissions that is aimed at preventing global temperature rises by 1.5C. SBSA investigated the various methods available through science based targets that take into consideration the unique energy context as well as the future growth of developing countries within which we operate. We piloted the Equity Method proposed by South African based Promethium Carbon with the intent to guide other African-based organisations in managing their direct carbon footprint, should the pilot be successful. The target would initially focus on our South African operations and would be expanded to all our African operations as part of our improvement journey. The method defined a clear target for Standard Bank operations in South Africa to reduce direct emissions by 79% by 2040 when compared to the 2014 base year. The model used was aligned to limit global temperature rises to below 1.5C, which means that the organisation is required to do more.

Those commitments aim at strengthening the Group's efforts to reduce its global carbon footprint by promoting the circular economy model that structurally reduces greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the consequences of global warming on water. Since 2017, these commitments are enshrined within SUEZ Sustainable Development Roadmap whose 5th commitment is: ''Adhere to the 2 degrees target by mitigating the causes of climate change\" and includes a target to reduce GHG emissions by 30% in 2030 (long time frame) and by 10% in 2021 (medium time frame) compared to 2014 (https://www.suez.com/en/Who-we-are/A-committedgroup/ Our-2017-2021-road-map). Each Business Unit of the Group is responsible for setting-up its own GHG mitigation target in line with the Group objective, according to their means. For instance, SUEZ NWS (Greater China) committed to reduce by 10% its global GHG emissions by 2021. Business Unit Australia committed to a 14% reduction and SUEZ Spain committed to reach 90% reduction of its scope 2 emissions by 2021.Nota Bene: In accordance with the GHG protocol, the base year emissions figure used in the calculation of the % of achievement of the target has been retroactively recalculated to reflect changes in the company that would otherwise compromise the consistency and relevance of the reported GHG emissions information. Considering the change of consolidation perimeter, the recalculated base year emissions figure used is 9 413 997 tons.The % of target achieved went from 5.5% in 2016 to 17.9% in 2017 and reached 25.1% in 2018. This progress gives confidence to the achievement of the 2030 target.Moreover, in April 2019, SUEZ has been supported by Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank to structure a sustainability linked-loan. In other words, the Group has indexed the financial terms of its main credit line to the achievement of 4 targets representing each of the Sustainable Development Roadmap Pillars.

In FY 2017, we dis-invested from our data center operations in India and Singapore wherein these operations were sold to a new entity called STT-GDC. For FY 2018 and FY 2019, TCL scope only include non data centre activities hence we are not including data centre data values in actual and target committed values in FY 2014 . The same is included as as a boundary and scope for our this year CDP reporting. Base Year FY 2014Total Emissions : 250,320 (Non Data centre :100,128 and Data Centre : 150,192)Target Year FY 2019Target emission (25% Reduction) : 25% reduction of Non Data Centre emissions (100,128)= 75,096Actual Performance FY 2019: 134,843With reference from FY 2014, with the increase in operational boundary w.r.t Non data centre activities, the emission number target has overshoot the target value. The company as such has done exceptionally well in increasing its RE quotient over the years. (0.75 million GJ in FY 2019 as compared 0.38 million GJ in FY 2014) This year we also completed the Renewable Energy Assessment studies with the help of expert consultants like Deloitte and PTS: Schneider Electric for India region and International Region (UK, Guam, North America, Japan, Portugal, Spain and Singapore) respectively. The study confirmed that Tata Communications has a scope to expand the existing Renewable Energy (RE) Capacity by 34.3 million units per annum which will increase our existing RE percentage ~ 16.5% to 32%. Further there is a reduction in Scope 1 emissions from the base year, despite the addition of new sites, because of the emission reduction initiatives introduced by Tata Communications. But, this reduction in Scope 1 emissions is more than offset by the increase in Scope 2 emissions from the base year mainly due to increased electricity consumption of the new sites that have been added to Tata Communication's operations. However, the required emission reduction measures will be taken to bring down the emissions in the coming years in order to meet the target.In FY 2020, we will take a new 5 year target and will work towards making that science based target.";NA;"Likely inclusion of RECs, ETS, or offsets";"India (breakdown matches)";5;0.8;5;2019;"2019-03-31";235744.23;"DWH 2014 S1, DWH 2014 S2L";NA;NA;134843;"C6 2019 S1, C6 2019 S2L";NA;NA;"-9cb-0e-0e-0fa-0fb-0za-7f-0zb-7f-0wbo-0ta-0rae-0rec-5ad";"Base year emissions check: -0wbo: stated base year emissions are 58% lower than calculated base year emissions (DWH 2014 | TOTAL 235744.23).; Found keyword(s): India; Organizational changes: Change in boundary: 27.3% increase in 2016,  Other: 0% increase in 2016";"18284-abs-S12L-2014-2019-1";"absolute"

With a zero-carbon future in mind, Spark is working to reduce its emissions by 25% by 2025 as an initial step. The target, set two years ago, formalises Spark's existing commitment to environmental responsibility and recognises New Zealanders' passion for a clean, green environment.In FY17 Spark reduced emissions by 12% owing largely to a more renewable electricity supply. Subsequently with higher national electricity grid carbon intensity, emissions in both FY18 & FY19 were above the FY16 base year level.

Our emissions are set to decline given our business direction in combination with the 90% renewable energy target.Spark began measuring our carbon emissions in FY06 and overall since then has reduced annual emissions at science-based rates.Since we set the target a few years ago, the Science-based Target Initiative (SBTi) has increased the stringency level for a target to be science-based. Spark plans to review our 2025 target and increase its stringency as necessary so that we are committing to achieve a less than two-degree science-based reduction level in line with SBTi requirements and the Paris Agreement.Note: FY16 base year emissions have been restated since last year's reporting to account for more recent emission factors published by the New Zealand Government.";NA;NA;"New Zealand (breakdown matches); annual";9;0.222222222222222;2.77777777777778;2019;"2019-06-30";26678;"DWH 2017 S1, DWH 2017 S2L, DWH 2017 S3.03, DWH 2017 S3.04, DWH 2017 S3.05, DWH 2017 S3.06: upstream completeness: 0.571428571428571";18301;"CCDS 2017 S1, CCDS 2017 S2L";28151;"C6 2019 S1, C6 2019 S2L, C6 2019 S3.03, C6 2019 S3.04, C6 2019 S3.05, C6 2019 S3.06, C6 2019 S3.08: upstream completeness: 0.625";18983;"C6 2019 S1, C6 2019 S2L";"-0cb-0ma-0e-0fa-0fb-0za-7f-0zb-7ga-0scn-0vo-0ta-5aa";"Base year emissions check: Base yr emissions for target scope, Scope 1+2 (location-based) +3 (upstream), has been calculated from the following scopes/categories: S1, S2L, S3.03, S3.04, S3.05, S3.06 (upstream completeness: 0.571428571428571). -0vo: stated base year emissions are 99% of calculated base year emissions (DWH 2017 | TOTAL 26678).; Found keyword(s): New Zealand";"18413-abs-S12L3-2016-2025-1";"absolute"

Today in 2019, we are proud to announce that thyssenkrupp strives to become climate neutral by 2050 in its own operations (scope 1 & 2) and the whole value chain (scope 3). We have also committed ourselves to the following mid-term targets, which have been approved by the SBTi:#IMPLEMENT: thyssenkrupp commits to reduce 30% of its absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2030 from a 2018 base year.The pillar #IMPLEMENT summarizes the measures we can take in our own operations to work towards climate neutrality. In order to reduce our scope 1 & 2 emissions by 30% we have identified four main levers. We will continue to work on improving our energy efficiency in course of our well-established Group-wide Energy Efficiency Program (GEEP) and increase our consumption of energy from renewable sources. We will transform our steel production from a blast furnace technology towards hydrogen-based direct reduction plants & electric arc furnaces by 2050. At the same time, we want to make waste gases arising during steel production available as raw materials for the production of base chemicals. Key activity here is the cross-industry demonstration project Carbon2Chem, seeking to bring this CCU solution to industry scale for our steel production in Duisburg.";NA;NA;NA;12;0;2.5;2018;"2018-09-30";24000000;"C6 2019 S1, C6 2019 S2L";NA;NA;24000000;"C6 2019 S1, C6 2019 S2L";NA;NA;"-0cb-0e-0e-0vm-5aa";"Base year emissions check: -0vm: stated base year emissions are 100% of calculated base year emissions (C6 2019 | TOTAL 2.4e+07).";"19080-abs-S12L-2018-2030-1";"absolute"

In the base year, 25,750,786 MTCO2e lifecycle emissions would have been generated if the material management choice had been decomposition in landfill instead of recycling, generating electricity or creating compost from organics.WM is the largest residential recycler in North America, regularly investing in programs such as our \"Recycle Often. Recycle Right.(R)\" campaign to encourage our residential, commercial and municipal customers to recycle and decrease contamination, and engaged broadly with stakeholders on means to increase the productivity and sustainable economics of recycling. Achieving this goal also requires that we work with designers and the manufacturing industry to avoid raw material processing, reduce the degree of material processing, and include recycled materials in their products. We do this by utilizing our materials recovery facility infrastructure to teach designers and manufacturers about the recycling process and through our Sustainability Services consulting group.

We are now working on our new corporate-wide science-based target of 25% reduction by 2025 from a 2016 baseline.The methodology used to set our science-based target was the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach (SDA) within the Sector-based approach. The SDA is a scientifically-informed method for companies to set GHG reduction targets necessary to stay within a 2C temperature rise above preindustrial levels. The method is based on the 2C scenario, one of the International Energy Agency's detailed CO2 sector scenarios modeled in their 2014 Energy Technology Perspectives report. The Energy Technology Perspectives report's budget is consistent with the representative concentration pathway 2.6 (RCP2.6) scenario from the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report, which gives the highest likelihood of staying within the global target temperature of less than 2C in the year 2100. The probability is estimated by the IPCC at a minimum of 66 percent. The IEA 2C scenario estimates an overall carbon budget of 1,055 GtCO2 up to 2050. The SDA method was developed by the partners (CDP, WRI, & WWF) of the Science Based Targets initiative with technical support from Ecofys.We recently resubmitted our commitment to the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) for the following reasons: cent Xerox was listed under the ''Software and services\" sector for our original commitment.

We implement energy and GHG reduction projects, we share best practices in energy management among our operations to achieve our goals and we contribute to global efforts to reduce emissions by advocating for carbon pricing. We have also set goals that drive investment in lower-carbon and alternative energy generation, including investments that ultimately contribute to the transition to a low-carbon economy. In 2010, Teck established a short term goal of implementing 75 kilotonnes (kt) of CO2e GHG reductions at our existing operations by 2015. Our long term goal is to implement 450kt of CO2e GHG reductions at our existing operations by 2030. While the number stated is an absolute value, the reductions or savings will be calculated against a business as usual scenario. Therefore, the 75 and 450kt will represent a decrease against where our emissions would have been had we not implemented reductions or savings projects. When these targets were established in 2011, the scope of emissions applicable under this target (i.e. applying to operations in operation in 2011) were forecasted to rise to approximately 3,600 kt of CO2e in 2015. From that forecast, our actual 2015 emissions were 22% lower than anticipated. Based on our 2015 emissions, this translated to a 1% absolute reduction from 2010. Projects are required to demonstrate and quantify the exact action that was undertaken (such as a change in technology or a change in behaviour) that has resulted in a reduction or savings in emissions that is attributable to a change in practice and that is non-reversible (these internal criteria are documented). To ensure that we are demonstrating valid reductions or savings, we measure and quantify these reductions on a project by project basis, following standard project accounting practices.

The main reason for these changes was the 2016 addition of ICL China YPH JV (purchased in late 2015) to the ICL GHG inventory. This large subsidiary is a significant GHG emitting site that was not accounted for in the original target setting. In addition, the recent decision on close the PMA Oil-Shale based CHP (combined heat and power) installation in Israel in late 2021 (and replace it with an NG based CHP plant), indicates 2022 as a realistic target year for the revised reduction target (that would also take into account the YPH activity).Note: Some emission figures appearing in this report for previous years differ slightly from past publications of the same figures in CDP and other reports. As part of our constant efforts to improve the accuracy and fullness of our vast and complex GHG inventory, we correct and/or re-baseline our emissions in some necessary cases (most commonly-active correction of identified errors/misunderstands in the internal data gathering process from specific site, retroactive corrections to some specific-ICL emission factors).

Setting a meaningful absolute GHG target is important to demonstrate that we are contributing to the mitigation of climate change in the global context. Additionally, establishing a GHG goal is in alignment with the commitments outlined in our EY Americas Environmental Statement. The US firm has shared its methodology for establishing GHG reduction targets with other EY member firms to promote knowledge sharing and assist other member firms looking to establish reduction targets. We took the following factors into consideration in setting our GHG target: cent Science: Studies from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on limiting the increase in global mean temperature to two degrees Celsius, cent Policy: Policy commitments, including the US commitment in the 21st Conference of the Parties cent GHG targets in place in the professional services industry. The vast majority of our carbon output comes from two sources: office energy consumption from our real estate portfolio and business travel, particularly air travel. In FY16, we formalized and initiated the execution of a set of specific real estate and travel initiatives to achieve our 2020 GHG target.

In this respect, we look at least to 2020 to maintain our objective of not increasing net emissions. This makes it a challenging target since it requires efficiency improvements due to fact that the company is growing at close to two-digit rate in employees and revenues. This is aligned with the 2 degrees objective of the Paris Agreement. In case the target is not achieved through direct improvements, we will offset the rest to meet the target. On top of this, Amadeus invests 16% of its revenues in R&D and this helps airlines and other customers to meet their own scope 1 and 2 targets.Amadeus maintains a carbon neutral growth policy, with 2015 as the baseline year. In 2015, the Amadeus Data Centre implemented a carbon neutral growth policy, offsetting all scope 1 and 2 emissions that exceed the levels reached in 2014. In 2016, this policy was expanded to the rest of the Amadeus Group, so we committed not to exceed scope 1 and 2 emissions reached in 2015.We have kept scope 1+2 emissions constant in the reporting year. Before 2018, we reported the emissions of our top sites included in our Environmental Management System (EMS). This represented the emissions of approximately 70% of our workforce and of our Data Center. From 2018 onwards, we have reported both the emissions obtained thought direct reporting (70% of workforce + Data Center) and have also included the estimation of the emissions from the remaining 30% of workforce that was not included in our reporting before 2018). This new methodology has been validated by our external verification company KPMG. Following Amadeus' carbon-neutral growth policy, we have been working with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to invest in Clean Development Mechanism projects in India.

Our target is to reduce our total aircraft emissions by 50% by 2050, relative to 2005. This target was devised by IATA together with industry representatives and experts, and reflects the requirement as stated by the IPCC that global CO2 emissions would need to reduce by 50% by 2050 to keep the increase in global average temperature to within 2 degrees. This target has been ratified by the aviation industry and is the long term focus of our activities to address our greenhouse gas emissions. Our sustainability programme began in 2007, which is our baseline year for all of our aircraft carbon reporting. We do not have baseline data for 2005, and so have entered our 2007 data as our baseline year for this target. We may look to estimate a 2005 baseline in the future. Achieving a 50% net reduction by 2050 will require a wide variety of measures and technology, including operational efficiencies, sustainable aviation fuels, innovations in aircraft design, and likely a global market based measure to address any emissions gap. We have been reducing our absolute emissions from our aircraft and so far can demonstrate a 21.2% decrease in total aircraft emissions relative to our 2007 baseline.

There is a triennial rationalization plan for energy consumption wich implies a 5% reduction. This legal requirement implies also an Anual Report on Progress with anual audits. The rationalization plan for energy consumption in progress for this target is 2015-2018. For this purpose only the year base is considered 2015 and ended at the end of the year 2018. During 2018 Luis Simoes' transport fleet showed a reduction in specific consumption of 4.67% compared to the base year of the rationalization plan (2015), with this indicator at 287.46 gep/VK, result of the implementation of energy efficiency measures applied to the fleet. From the measures recommended in the rationalization plan, it can be seen that, regarding the change of the vehicles, about 200% is achieved beyond the recommended. Despite the efforts and high financial investment in the purchase of more efficient and efficiency-enhancing equipment (in the case of TMS) it was not possible to achieve a 5% reduction, but it was considerably close, with a deviation of only 0,34%.

IPC - International Post Corporation who used SBT Science Based Target to set our Targetted reduction.\"\" In 2013, the 24 postal organisations in IPC's EMMS group had almost reached their 2020 target of a 20% reduction in absolute emissions. IPC was looking for ways to make more progress and broaden the coverage to include Scope 3 emissions generated by sub-contracted and outsourced transport. The aim was to focus on delivery efficiency, rather than the reduction of total volumes of greenhouse gas emissions. IPC decided to commit to the Science-Based Targets initiative in order to ensure that we developed a target that was in line with the reductions required to meet the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) recommended goal of limiting global warming to 2 C. Our overall aim is to minimise the postal sector's carbon footprint by encouraging participants to improve their carbon management and achieve sustainable greenhouse gas emissions reductions.Irish Government has set a Target of 33 % Energy Reduction for Energy Use ( Scope 1 & 2 )For our Scope 1 - Thermal Fuel for Heating. Scope 1 has reduced by 9.5% since 2009.Our Thermal CO2 Scope 1 in 2009 was 4,563 Tons CO2. We had reduced Thermal by 1,072 Tons CO2 or 23.5% to 4,127 Tons in 2018. However due to Colder weather in Quarter 1 of 2018 our thermal Kwh usage increased in 2018 resulting in reduced % reduction to 9.5% and reduced reduction of 436 Tons CO2.By June 2019 we have successfully restored our Energy Reduction of thermal to 24 % of base year 2009. We have achieved this Reduction through Investment in technology to better control our heating through Internet based Heating Controls, through investment in new energy efficient buildings. Also Installed Gas & Electric Metering & Monitoring in 43 of our Larger Offices. Our Target is to Reduce our Energy Use ( thermal & electric) in our Buildings by 33 % by 2020.";NA;NA;NA;11;0.818181818181818;3;2018;"2018-12-31";23376;"C5.1 2019 S1";NA;NA;26572;"C6 2019 S1";NA;NA;"-0fa-0fa-0fa-0fa-0db-0za-7ga-0zb-7ga-0wakq-0rbd-2ak-2fakq-5ab";"Base year emissions check: -0wakq: stated base year emissions are 22% higher than calculated base year emissions (C5.1 2019 | TOTAL 3740.16).; Organizational changes: Change in methodology: 5.0% decreased in 2017";"41714-abs-S1-2009-2020-1";"absolute"

We were therefore looking for ways to make more progress and broaden the coverage to include Scope 3 emissions generated by sub-contracted and outsourced transport. The aim was to focus on delivery efficiency, rather than the reduction of total volumes of greenhouse gas emissions. IPC decided to commit to the Science-Based Targets initiative in order to ensure that we developed a target that was in line with the reductions required to meet the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) recommended goal of limiting global warming to 2 C. Our overall aim is to minimise the postal sector's carbon footprint by encouraging participants to improve their carbon management and achieve sustainable greenhouse gas emissions reductions. We have increased our Transport CO2 from 18,813 Tons in 2009 to 22,256 Tons in 2018 = this is because of increased KM due to Increased Parcel Volumes which continue to grow month on month . In 2018 we introduced our first Electric Vans x 10 Renault Kangoos x further 36 x LDV 3.5 Ton vans in Dublin in June 2019 & Trikes x 10 in Dublin coupled with Eco Driver Training, installation of Fleet Telematics and have achieved ISO 50001 in our Fleet Transport. We have seen an improvement in fuel efficiency this year of nearly 10 % due to all these measures. Also the replacement of 34 HGV Trucks to Euro 6 by the end of 2019 (45 % of our HGV Fleet will be Euro 6 by year end), All remaining trucks are now Euro 5. In 2019 we are replacing a further 700 of our smaller delivery vehicles at the moment with Euro 6. This will mean our entire fleet of delivery vans are now Euro 6. We have plans to have 750 Electric vehicles in our fleet by 2022All these actions will help bring reductions in CO2 in Transport Diesel for 2019 and years ahead.Our target is to improve Fuel Efficiency which we have achieved 10% improved efficency this year due to the above actions. As parcel deliveries continue to grow, our total fuel usage for road transport Scope 1 will continue to grow. The only way we can stem the growth is by switching to electric vehicles or at considering options for CNG Gas for some of our HGV fleet .

Our influence is limited in rented objects. We evaluate our green energy in climate reporting based on the LCA-method (includes scope 3).

The emissions scope additionally includes all emissions from our company owned transportation/delivery fleet and our operations/admin ground fleet. Excluded from the scope are fugitive emissions and emissions from our privately owned wood burning boilers. Boiler emissions are excluded from scope 1 emissions because they utilize bio-based wood waste as fuel. If sales continue to increase as projected we can reasonably expect that emissions will also increase over time so it is expected that we will need to employ renewable or low-carbon energy sources by 2030 to be able to reach this absolute energy reduction target.During 2016 we met our intensity target of 25% emissions reduction. We used a baseline of 2009 and had a goal of reaching this by 2019.

There are significant cost and energy savings with this transformation, working out at $11 million (AUD) each year from an electricity perspective. The reduction in fuel usage represents total annual savings of around $1 million. Overall since 2010 the program has led to cost avoidance of $47m in electricity alone.

Following the acquisition of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.'s printer business in 2018, HP set a goal to decrease total Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions from global operations (all owned or leased facilities and transportation fleet within our operational control) by 60% by 2025, compared to 2015. This target underwent and passed an official target validation by the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi). The SBTi notified HP of their approval of this target on July 4, 2019. HP's Scope 3 targets had been previously validated by the SBTi. This target also follows HP's previously set and met SBTi-approved target of a 25% reduction in absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2025,In 2018, GHG emissions from HP owned or leased facilities and transportation fleet decreased compared to 2015. In 2018, HP's global operations produced 229,600 tonnes of Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2e emissions, an 8% reduction compared to 2017 and a 41% reduction from our 2015 baseline of 388,700 tonnes of CO2e. After 40% of the time (4 yr/10 yrs), we are 68% of the way towards goal completion (41%/60%). Following the acquisition of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.'s printer business on November 1, 2017 (day 1 of HP's FY18), we recalculated energy use, water consumption, and Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions data from operations back to the baseline of 2015, in order to maintain our goals' baseline year of 2015. This process also included an update of the intensity factors used to extrapolate energy use and water consumption data for sites where direct tracked data was not available. The new intensity factors, along with recently confirmed square footage data, will more accurately reflect HP's footprint since the previous 2015 baseline which used intensity factors based on pre-separation Hewlett Packard Company facilities.

This goal involves a significant multi-year effort to design a complex and integrated CCS system with a capacity to achieve the absolute reduction target. Installation of any CCS system and achieving the desired GHG reduction would be subject to the company's liquidity and its value creation index investment threshold, as well as securing funding commitments and permits. The Elk Hills Field is California's largest in-state supplier of natural gas, providing nearly half of California's natural gas production. The 550-megawatt Elk Hills Power Plant generates electricity from local natural gas to power the Elk Hills Field and surrounding fields and supply enough electricity to a local utility and California's electric grid to power up to 350,000 homes. The reliable electricity supply from the Elk Hills Power Plant has enabled CRC to operate the Elk Hills Field and surrounding fields with electric-powered equipment that increases energy efficiency and reduces air emissions. CRC's 2030 Carbon Sustainability Goal aims to make Elk Hills a model of long-term carbon capture and storage. CRC has a dedicated Enhanced Oil Recovery team that is designing a system to collect CO2 from the Elk Hills Power Plant and inject it into underground oil and natural gas formations at Elk Hills for enhanced oil recovery and long-term carbon sequestration. Several oil and gas formations at Elk Hills have already been identified as strong candidates for CO2 enhanced oil recovery. Under this process, the CO2 sweeps oil from the pore space in the formation to producing wells, permanently trapping a significant quantity of the injected CO2 in the pore space. At the surface, the remaining CO2 is separated from the oil and recycled for injection in a closed loop, supplemented by additional CO2 from the power plant. This project, if permitted, funded and installed, would render the Elk Hills Power Plant essentially carbon-neutral and help the state meets its long-term greenhouse gas reduction goals, while continuing to supply affordable, reliable and secure energy for California by Californians for decades to come.";NA;NA;NA;13;0.0769230769230769;1.76470588235294;2018;"2018-12-31";NA;NA;NA;NA;3830951;"C6 2019 S1, C6 2019 S2L";NA;NA;"-0cb-0e-0zb-7f-5ad";NA;"59242-abs-S12L-2013-2030-1";"absolute"

This was achieved through our energy efficiency program, but also due to a reduction in the number of assets within our portfolio, and because we have reduced the gross lettable area (GLA) by 7 per cent. The methodology for establishing this target included the use of asset specific targets from across the portfolio and aggregating them to form a corporate-wide target. Target setting is a key component of our approach to continuous environmental improvement and achieving the 'Low carbon smart assets' pillar of our Sustainability strategy. Vicinity sets annual performance targets to drive continuous improvement across our asset portfolio in key environmental metrics such as energy, carbon emissions, waste and water.

After reviewing both heritage greenhouse gas reduction goals, for Dell Technologies we adopted a heritage EMC's absolute GHG reduction goal, which was developed using the science-based CFACT methodology. This goal was introduced in the Dell Technologies Climate Change 2017 CDP report. Dell Technologies received (re)approval of this goal as a Science Based Target in October of 2017 and re-approved on May 2019. The scope of this goal includes all Dell Technologies except for VMware.
