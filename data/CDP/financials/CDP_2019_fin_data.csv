The reduction target is based on our total emissions of Scope 1, Scope 2 (market based) and Scope 3 according to the VfU standard.Since we are constantly expanding the data collection of our Scope 3 emissions, we lowered the percentage of emissions in scope from originally 100 % to 67 % from 2017 onward, because in base year 2007 we did not collect data of a) employee commuting which is responsible for 29.4 % of our total CO2e emissions, and b) upstream transportation for our document logistic and internal relocations which is responsible for 3.6 % of our total CO2 emissions in 2018.Our subsidiaries (such as Comdirect Bank AG or mBank) are generally not covered by the emission reduction target mentioned above. Only the emissions caused by subsidiaries that are located within the same facilities as Commerzbank AG Germany are included.Commerzbank is aware of the fact, that ""financed emissions"" are relevant according to GHG protocol. Nevertheless, Commerzbank's financed emissions are not part of the emission reduction target, as this was no requirement in the year the emission reduction target was formulated. More importantly, there is not a concerted way to calculate Scope 3 emissions of financial institutions and to assess these emissions against a 2C target.

We explain our organizational and operational boundary (consolidation approach) in accordance with the GHG protocol in our ING Reporting Protocol available on ING.com.Science-based targets: In 2014, when preparing to set new global targets against our base year (2014) we consulted Ecofys, consultant in renewable energy, energy & carbon efficiency, energy systems & markets and energy & climate policy. Ecofys, using the 'Mind the Science' methodology and tooling co-developed by Ecofys, CDP, WRI and WWF, conducted an assessment of our GHG emissions and inventory and calculated targets using the 'convergence principle' to map out a 2-degree pathway to 2020 using base year 2013 (see attached pdf 'Mind the Science_SBT ING Group'). The result of this assessment was that ING should reduce absolute emissions by 10.7% by 2017 and by 18.1% by 2020 compared to 2013 in order to stay in line with the 2-degree pathway. The decision was made to push for a more ambitious target of 20% by 2020 and this was approved by the ING's Chief Operating Officer in 2015. We achieved this outcome in 2016 therefore we set new targets in 2017. These targets were proposed to ING's Chief Operations Officer and members of the Board in 2017. The decision was to adopt this new ambitious target of 50% absolute emissions reduction and to keep our original base year of 2014. This decision means that our publicly communicated target is much more ambitious than the original target recommended via the Mind the Science tool by more than 31%. This reduction target is set against our total extrapolated scope 1,2 and 3 CO2 equivalent emissions which takes into account CO2, CH4 and N2O.

(p.17) An elaborate explanation can also be found in our Science-based targets check form attached. Science-based targets: In 2014, when preparing to set new global targets against our base year (2014) we consulted Ecofys, consultant in renewable energy, energy & carbon efficiency, energy systems & markets and energy & climate policy. Ecofys, using the 'Mind the Science' methodology and tooling co-developed by Ecofys, CDP, WRI and WWF, conducted an assessment of our GHG emissions and inventory and calculated targets using the 'convergence principle' to map out a 2-degree pathway to 2020 using base year 2013 (see attached pdf 'Mind the Science_SBT ING Group'). The result of this assessment was that ING should reduce absolute emissions by 10.7% by 2017 and by 18.1% by 2020 compared to 2013 in order to stay in line with the 2-degree pathway. The decision was made to push for a more ambitious target of 20% by 2020 and this was approved by the ING's Chief Operating Officer in 2015. We achieved this outcome in 2016 therefore we set new targets in 2017. These targets were proposed to ING's Chief Operations Officer and members of the Board in 2017. The decision was to adopt this new ambitious target of 50% absolute emissions reduction and to keep our original base year of 2014. This decision means that our publicly communicated target is much more ambitious than the original target recommended via the Mind the Science tool by more than 31%.

In 2016, the GHG Inventory was created from 2012 to 2015 and reported to the government. In August 2017, IBK worked to reach our 2018 GHG reduction targets set in consultation with the government. In March 2018, IBK prepared a report on GHG emissions for 2017 and reported it to the government. In August 2018, IBK received GHG reduction target for 2019 through consultation with the government. The Ministry of Land Transport and Marine Affairs has given the IBK annual GHG reduction targets since 2017. The criteria for GHG reduction targets are based on the ''National 2020 GHG reduction roadmap"". THe MRV procedure was performed according to the regulation. IBK's reduction efforts in 2018 produced 61,300 tonnes, 9.76% less than the permissible emission of 67,937 tonnes. IBK's emissions by 2018 are 61,300.44 tons. the government has allocated an emission allowance of 67,937 tonnes based on IBK's 2018 BAU projected emissions. IBK, on the other hand, produced 61,300.44 tons in 2018 in an effort to reduce GHG emissions. The reduction rate is 9.76%. Government reduction targets are provided annually. In 2030, the rate of government building reduction was 18.1% of BAU emissions. This target has been approved as science-based by the Science-Based Targets initiative. 2) Internal targetWe have established a stronger internal reduction target than the government reduction target.

Currently, non-science based targets are released by banks, as there is no methodology available.In 2018, the Group continued to reduce the use of paper per staff member, which fell by 1.3% compared with 2017. Additionally, there was an increase in the use of recycled paper of 3.4% which, together with certified sustainable paper, now represents 89.6% of the total. In Italy, these results were also achieved through the implementation of various paperless initiatives. Among these measures, particularly worthy of note are the paperless contracts and accounts project, extended during the year to other banking products and services, the consultation of information sheets on screens, online statement and the Zero Carta (''Zero Paper"") project in training initiatives. Thanks to these initiatives, it was possible to avoid the use of over 3,265 tonnes of paper, corresponding to a reduction in CO2 emissions of around 6,330 tonnes, with cost savings of over 4.7 million euro. In the International Subsidiary Banks, the development of dematerialisation processes/paperless branches, being a component of the DigiCal model, has been implemented at Privredna Banka Zagreb (Croatia), CIB Bank (Hungary), Intesa Sanpaolo Banka Bosna i Hercegovina and VUB Banka (Slovakia), enabling an overall saving of around 159 tonnes of paper in 2018.";NA;NA;NA;6;0,333333333333333;2,6;2018;"2018-12-31";496,57;"DWH 2013 S3.01";NA;NA;5861,26;"C6 2019 S3.01";NA;NA;"-0fa-0fa-0fa-0za-7f-0zb-7f-0wao-0rad-0rab-0rea-0rea-0rcd-0rcd-0rcd-0rcd-0rcd-5ad";"Base year emissions check: -0wao: stated base year emissions are 3245% higher than calculated base year emissions (DWH 2013 | TOTAL 496.57).; Organizational changes: Change in methodology: 7.4% increased in 2018,  Acquisitions: 7.6% increased in 2018,  Other: 17.2% increased in 2018, Other: 6.1% increased in 2017,  Change in methodology: 4.3% increased in 2017, Change in methodology: 1.8% decrease in 2016, Change in methodology: 1.2% decrease in 2015, Change in methodology: 1.3% decrease in 2014, Change in methodology: 0.8% increase in 2013";"9363-abs-S3-2012-2022-1";"absolute";"fin"

It was developed in 2016, from the review of the material themes of Duratex that resulted in the company's Sustainability Strategy, to start in 2017. This target only covers Duratex's operations in Brazil, excluding Ceusa (a ceramic company acquired in 2017, after the definition of the annual milestones that arised from the targets). In 2012, Duratex's capital participation in Tablemac (now called Duratex Colombia) increased from 25% to 37%, and their emissions were not yet accounted for, which is why the Scopes emissions percentage was 100% in the base year. In, 2018, the operations covered in the target would represent 73.26% of direct emissions.Duratexs Sustainability Strategy review should occur every 3 years. Currently, the Strategy and its targets are under review. The expected evolution to reach the target in 2025 was not linear, since variable production projections were taken into account. Considering the projections made at the time of the milestones elaboration, the emissions from Duratex's Brazilian operations in 2018, which include the Deca (Metals and Ceramics), Hydra and Wood (Forest and Panels) divisions, totaled 132,888.64 tCO2e, which are lower compared to the milestone expected for 2018 (178,562.77 tCO2e), and also inferior to 75% of the baseline.

In 2012 we had no renewable power consumption and started installing photo-voltaics in 2015 and purchasing 100% renewable electricity in 2016. In addition Kiwi Property has had an energy efficiency programme for 16 years, which has created highly efficient buildings, which is demonstrate by our commercial buildings are NABERNZ rated excellent (4 stars) to world's best practice (5.5 stars). Kiwi Property has to invest heavily to increase the energy savings, for example installing 4 new photo-voltaic arrays and investing $750,000 in new chiller plants. We have reduced our carbon footprint (all scopes) by 3,584tCO2e.It will be difficult for Kiwi Property to maintain the high levels of carbon emission reduction, especially given the large greenfield development. Emissions from buildings built and tenanted from this site will significantly increase our emissions. Which is why although this Science Based emission target has been achieved, we have not created a higher target for 2020, Kiwi Property has signed up to the Science Based Organisation and set Science Based Targets in 2016. Currently Science Based Organisation are unable to confirm Financial Institutions Science Based Targets. The targets are set to achieve under a 2oC temperature increase with year on year reductions of 2.1% achieving a 40% reduction by 2030 and 55% reduction by 2050. However, given the latest climate change science stating the world needs to aim for 1.5 degree Celsius rise, we are currently reviewing our targets.Kiwi Property has a protocol, in accordance with the GHG Protocol, for comparing like for like, that previous years carbon emissions and the base year will be recalculated when a new or sold asset represents greater than 5% of the total carbon footprint. In addition, the new asset's carbon footprint can only be included if the asset had been in operation for the year in question. In 2018 Kiwi Property sold two buildings, both exceeded the 5% threshold and were in the portfolio since the base year.

This target was reported for the past few years through the CDP. This reduction target is part of a broader carbon neutrality commitment (also announced in 2015) to achieve and maintain carbon neutrality for all Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from MetLife's owned and leased office facilities around the world, from the Auto and Home Vehicle Fleet, and from Scope 3 business travel by the end of 2016.

This is significant progress towards our intended target of a 15% reduction and a demonstration of our commitment towards effectively managing our use of energy. We are continuously improving our transition to a low-carbon economy, migrating from an energy intensity-based target calculation methodology to one that is carbon-based. In 2018 we decided to pursue a science-based target (SBT) on our direct emissions that is aimed at preventing global temperature rises by 1.5C. SBSA investigated the various methods available through science based targets that take into consideration the unique energy context as well as the future growth of developing countries within which we operate. We piloted the Equity Method proposed by South African based Promethium Carbon with the intent to guide other African-based organisations in managing their direct carbon footprint, should the pilot be successful. The target would initially focus on our South African operations and would be expanded to all our African operations as part of our improvement journey. The method defined a clear target for Standard Bank operations in South Africa to reduce direct emissions by 79% by 2040 when compared to the 2014 base year. The model used was aligned to limit global temperature rises to below 1.5C, which means that the organisation is required to do more. In 2019 we intend to set the example and this will require us to break the norms of conventional building designs and aim to develop facilities that are able to sustain operations in the absence of resources and target the development of net zero facilities, green buildings and adopting low carbon energy sources.";NA;NA;"South Africa (breakdown matches)";8;0,375;1,66666666666667;2018;"2018-12-31";283814;"C5.1 2019 S2L";NA;NA;202586;"C6 2019 S2L";NA;NA;"-0ca-0fb-0e-0fb-0vk-0vo-0ta-0rec-0rae-5aa";"Base year emissions check: -0vk: stated base year emissions are 100% of calculated base year emissions (C5.1 2019 | TOTAL 283814). -0vo: stated base year emissions are 100% of calculated base year emissions (DWH 2015 | TOTAL 283314).; Found keyword(s): South Africa; Organizational changes: Other: 0.51% decrease in 2016,  Change in boundary: 100% increase in 2016";"17637-abs-S2L-2014-2023-1";"absolute";"fin"

Estimates are volatile, and depend notably on the scope and datacollection methods used in the various companies, as well as changes in reference emission factors. For thisreason, while the 2018 results are very encouraging, CNP Assurances remains vigilant and committed. CNP Assurances has set a goal of reducing the end-2014 level by 20% by 2020 (a slightly faster pace than the commitments made by the European Union in the Paris agreement), notably through dialogue with the companies whose shares it holds.

As the GHG emissions level of the base year is relatively low for services building sector, the reduction of emissions is particularly complicated to achieve. Moreover, the architectural and regulatory framework for buildings refurbishment in Paris is very restrictive and most of the assets are in this geography Lastly, Gecina avoid and compensate net carbon emissions of the portfolio to reach annual neutrality starting from 2016 by supporting low carbon energy production, optimization of uses and setting up a compensation fund.

Rabobank is also as sustainable as possible in its purchasing policies, attempting to use renewable raw materials and contracts based on circular economic principles wherever we can. The Operations department also serves as an expertise centre for the group as a whole. We promote a situation where our employees spend as little time on the road as possible. In the Netherlands, we encourage the shared use of our offices by all employees and optimise opportunities for remote communications.

The target requires a 30% reduction in Scope 1 + 2 emissions per net revenue in rupees crore (Rs Cr) over a period of 5 years. Starting from 2017-2018 (base year) and ending in 2022-2023. This target is outlined in our Environment Policy. The target for 2022-2023 is thus 30% of 5.19 = 3.63 MT of CO2e/ Net Rev in Cr. We have already achieved 40% of this target as our emissions per net revenue (in crores) has reduced from 5.19 last year to 4.57 in FY 2018-2019. Here 2018 refers to FY 2017-2018 and 2023 refers to FY 2022-2023. This is a NEW target. Since our target is an intensity target and the Bank is expanding its operations we expect our absolute emissions to increase for all scopes (1, 2 and 3).

Befimmo also aims to limit its CO2e emissions, in particular by continuing to invest in renewable energy generation. Depending on the configuration of the buildings and any subsidies granted on account of their geographical situation, a study of the photovoltaic potential carried out in 2017 enabled Befimmo to identify a number of opportunities for projects to be emplemented quickly, together with the technical and financial resources required. All the sites identified as having a high potential are being installed or extended. This work on two buildings located in Brussels and representing an additional area of some 650 m of solar panels will be completed during the first quarter of 2019. The additional area will complement the 3,854 m of panels already installed.

It is well aware that this ambitious aim of reducing its environmental impact can be influenced by the constantly changing needs and behaviours of society, the world of work, especially through the use of new technologies and/or a new form of mobility that is now more geared towards electricity, but it intends to stand firmly by this target.This approach assumes flexibility and anticipation of the electricity needs that Befimmo will immediately integrate into all of its projects. Befimmo also aims to limit its CO2e emissions, in particular by continuing to invest in renewable energy generation. Depending on the configuration of the buildings and any subsidies granted on account of their geographical situation, a study of the photovoltaic potential carried out in 2017 enabled Befimmo to identify a number of opportunities for projects to be emplemented quickly, together with the technical and financial resources required. All the sites identified as having a high potential are being installed or extended. This work on two buildings located in Brussels and representing an additional area of some 650 m of solar panels will be completed during the first quarter of 2019.

In 2018, total emissions in our production network amounted to 962.545 tonnes of CO2, a 24% decrease in overall CO2 emissions when compared to 2015 (marked based calculation for Scope2 emissions). This means that we already achieved our 2020 target. Increase of energy efficiency was one key factor. Our target is to reduce energy consumption per vehicle produced by 45% between 2006 and 2020. By 2018 we achieved a 38% reduction. Supply of energy from renewable sources was another key element. In 2018 we purchased for vehicle production about 1,600 GWh of electricity, heat and cooling from renewable sources, among other things via certificates of origin. All European production sites are delivered with green electricity. In Spartanburg (USA) we replaced around 50% of our natural gas needs by utilizing landfill gas. In the next years we want to continue to expand electricity supply from renewable sources at our plants outside of Europe.

Since Abs1 as well as the renewable energy target in C4.2 are interim targets to achieve Abs2, measures in 2018 are the same as described there. Procedure: On the way to 100% renewable energy supply of our locations BMW Group takes a holistic approach. Top priority is given to systematic reduction of energy consumption, as energy savings are always the best alternative, both for the environment and for our business. To cover the remaining energy requirements, we are expanding our own renewable energy generation systems and are increasingly drawing power from local renewable sources. The renewable energy target in C4.2 addresses only CO2-emissions from purchased electricity. Abs1 includes also emissions from heat supply as well as from fuel combustion inside the BMW Group. On a mid to long-term perspective we see the potential to replace in an economically reasonable way fossil fuels by renewable fuels (e.g. biogas) and are doing this e.g. in Spartanburg (USA) with landfill gas. Scope of target: The emissions in Scope include all BMW Group locations including the Joint Venture locations in China. It excludes emissions from company owned vehicles and airplanes. From the 2015 emissions figures we get as percentage of emissions in scope 94%. Remark: To calculate the % of emissions in scope we included in the denominator emissions from company owned cars and planes since these are BMW Group Scope 1 & Scope 2 emissions.

Based on those new initiatives, and other energy saving programs implemented previously by Broadridge, in late 2014 Broadridge decided to make a voluntary commitment to reduce GHG emissions and emissions intensity. The details of that GHG reduction target commitment are as follows: by the end of 2020, Broadridge will reduce its Scope 1 + Scope 2 emissions total by 7.5% from its 2013 baseline emissions level, on an absolute GHG emissions basis. Also by the end of 2020, Broadridge will reduce its Scope 1 + Scope 2 total GHG emissions intensity by 30% from its 2013 baseline emissions levels, on an intensity basis of total Scope 1 + Scope 2 GHG emissions per $ Million of revenue. After the first six (6) years of this seven (7) year target commitment program, Broadridge's performance progress as of this 2019 CDP report has achieved the absolute GHG emissions reduction target commitment ahead of schedule, with an absolute emissions reduction of 24.2% from 2013 to 2019. This target's early achivement was due primarily to implementation of numerous energy efficiency and energy use reduction projects over the last 6 years; corporate streamlining/operational efficiency improvements from consolidating major printing operations after a large acquisition made at the beginning of 2017; and closing a captive Broadridge data center in FY2018 and shifting those operations to an existing contracted data host. Based on this performance success, in FY2020 Broadridge will be evaluating options for setting a new, long-term GHG emissions reduction target, as part of its expanding program for climate change and carbon management. (Note: While the relative, ""greening"" of the U.S. electrical grid during this time period, due to the displacement of coal by natural gas for power generation, has contributed somewhat to these GHG emissions reductions overall, Broadridge's corporate-wide electricity usage has decreased by 23% over the entire target commitment period - - despite 29% growth in total corporate revenues contemporaneously.)";NA;NA;NA;6;0,666666666666667;1,07142857142857;2019;"2019-04-30";73288;"C5.1 2019 S1, C5.1 2019 S2L";NA;NA;55529;"C6 2019 S1, C6 2019 S2L";NA;NA;"-0ca-0fa-0fb-0fa-0fb-0fb-0da-0db-0za-7f-0zb-7f-0vk-0waoq-0reb-0reb-5aa";"Base year emissions check: -0vk: stated base year emissions are 100% of calculated base year emissions (C5.1 2019 | TOTAL 73288). -0waoq: stated base year emissions are 48% higher than calculated base year emissions (DWH 2013 | TOTAL 49611).; Organizational changes: Other: 7.9% decreased in 2018, Other: 17.7% decreased in 2017";"2326-abs-S12L-2013-2020-1";"absolute";"fin+"

Energy Efficiency Program - We accelerate proof points for our customers for carbon technologies by investing over 100 million in energy efficiency measures at our sites: most of the applied solutions are part of our portfolio and we expect a payback within five years and annual savings of 20 million. 2. Distributed Energy Systems - We will create showcases of distributed energy systems at our own sites (e.g. combining power generation, such as wind, PV with storage solutions and intelligent energy management technologies) 3. Car Fleet - Our car fleet (about 48,000 vehicles accounting for roughly 300,000 tons of annual CO2 emissions) is included in our CO2-neutral aspiration. We will continue to include CO2 emission factors as an integral part of our local car fleet policies around the world 4. Green Electricity: We are changing our power purchasing guidelines and move towards a significantly cleaner power mix with a focus on renewable energies and gas. We also aim at creating opportunities for further businesses as part of green electricity purchase (PPA) projects. We expect to achieve our interim target of 50% reduction by 2020 mainly without offsetting carbon emissions. As we focus on domestic measures to reduce our carbon footprint, it is too early to estimate to what extent carbon offsets will be needed beyond 2020. Our carbon neutral goal for 2030 is considered as science-based by the SBT initiative. However, it is not yet approved. Due to a disagreement on a scope 3 target, we decided not to join the SBT initiative. We consider our CO2-neutral program as a long-term target as we will remain carbon neutral post 2030. According to the CDP definition of a long-term target (post 2035), this target translates into a separate long-term absolute target - see next line.

Our calculated waste recycling ratio in FY2018 increased to 93% (compared to 91% in FY2017). We believe this represents further positive progress and is the product of continued process improvements introduced by our Administrations & Workplace Services team to implement our waste segregation scheme in all UK offices and to look for more sustainable solutions to minimising and disposing of our waste. This comprises office floor recycling stations, food waste minimisation and redistribution programmes, waste paper from print activities as well as numerous events to engage our staff and raise awareness of the requirement for recycling effectively.

The increase of the CO2 footprint compared to 2017, is mainly caused by the increase of FTE's as a result of acquisitions (Generali Nederland). The acquisitions resulted in an increase of commuter travel which has a negative impact on a.s.r.'s footprint. The scope 1 emissions decreased by 70 tonnes of CO2-equivalent, mainly due to the use of fewer and more economical lease cars. The scope 2 emissions remains 0 as a.s.r. using self-generated electricity from solar cells in combination with zero emission Swedish wind electricity. However, the scope 3 emissions increased by 389 tonnes of CO2-equivalent. This is due to an increase in commuter traffic in kilometres, with car use increasing proportionally (compared to, for example, public transport use).

Goal is to reduce the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by 10% from 2015 to 2020. This is measured by the electricity and greenhouse emissions intensity ratio per sq.m. including both communal and tenant areas. These ratios are normalised based on year of construction, vacancy, degree days and area and all electricity is 100% green. In 2017 ASR DCRF started collecting actual usage data from the individual units. The results for 2018 have not arrived yet, therefore the results below are focussing on the collective consumption only. The tenant data will be disclosed in the GRESB 2019 and the Fund's annual report 2020.Since 2015, the electricity intensity ratio decreased by 24% and the greenhouse gas intensity ratio by 55%. Water consumption decreased by 41% since 2016 and waste increased by 4% since 2017. The Fund's influence on the latter is relatively small since waste collection primarily is a municipal responsibility. The decreases show that the focus on its sustainable policy, acquisitions, maintenance and extensive sustainable renovation of the Fund's current portfolio have had a positive impact on the performance indicators. As soon asthe tenant consumption is disclosed, the Fund will decide whether or not to sharpen its reduction targets within the ASR DCRF Three Year Businessplan 2020-2022.For further detailed information please see https://en.asrrealestate.nl/media/214518/asr-dcrf-csr-annual-report-2018.pdf";NA;NA;"annual";4;0,5;2,5;2018;"2018-12-31";NA;NA;NA;NA;0;"C6 2019 S3.13";NA;NA;"-0ma-0e-0fb-0fb-0fb-0fb-0fa-0zb-7f-5ad";NA;"68135-abs-S3-2016-2020-1";"absolute";"fin+"

The target refers to the Copenhagen Conference where the BMW Group communicated to reduce these emissions by 25% until 2020. The 25 % reduction is to be achieved by continuous development of our Efficient Dynamics (ED) strategy. Since 2007 our ED is a comprehensive technologic approach for the consistent reduction of fuel consumption and emissions in the standard configuration of all cars of the BMW Group. It includes both highly-efficient automobiles with gradually refined combustion engines and all-electric cars and low-emission plug-in hybrids. ED technologies include e.g. efficient engines, optimized aerodynamics, intelligent energy management, light-weight design or Auto Start Stop function. Our future is electric. We have already more than 10 PHEV models (in 2, 3, 5 and 7 Series, X1, X5 and the MINI Countryman) and are active in 74 markets worldwide. In 2018, we sold 142,617 electrified vehicles worldwide (BEVs: 34,829; PHEVs: 107,788), a further increase in volume by 38.4% compared to 2017, and led e.g. in 2018 the market for electrified vehicles in Europe. Our fleet averaged CO2 emissions per kilometer calculated from the core market values EU28, USA, China, Japan and Korea were 141 g CO2/km. This value is not directly comparable to the 2017 value of 141 g CO2/km as reported in our last years CDP response due to a change in regulation. Since 2018 cars in EU28 are approved according to the new driving cycle WLTP but compliance with EU fleet CO2 emission regulation until 2021 is done in the NEDC. Retroactive calculation of NEDC fleet emissions from the WLTP values, so called ""NEDC corr."" values, are higher due to the amended WLTP test constraints (2017: 122 in NEDC, 128 in NEDC corr.). Using the NEDC corr. value also in 2017 to keep comparability we find as Group value 143 g CO2 / km. This means a 1.4% reduction of fleet averaged CO2 emissions of 2018 when compared to 2017. We set clear goals for sustainable mobility: A total of half a million electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids on the roads by the end of 2019. 25 electrified models already in 2023, more than half of them pure electric, and an expected share in our newly sold vehicle fleet in 2025 between 15 and 25%.";NA;NA;NA;12;0,833333333333333;2,08333333333333;2018;"2018-12-31";NA;NA;NA;NA;52759567;"C6 2019 S3.11";NA;NA;"-6c-0e-0fa-0fa-0e-0za-7f-0zb-7f-0rec-0rcd-0rec-0rec-0rcd-0rec-0rbd-0rec-0rae-0rec-0rad-0rce-0rec-6fn";"Missing info: % change anticipated in absolute Scope 3 emissions; Organizational changes: Other: 0.1% decreased in 2018, Change in methodology: 1.3% increased in 2017,  Other: 0.4% decreased in 2017, Other: 0.4% increase in 2016,  Change in methodology: 4.5% decrease in 2016, Other: 0.46% decrease in 2015,  Change in methodology: 6.26% decrease in 2015, Other: 2.08% increase in 2014,  Change in boundary: 7.84% increase in 2014, Other: 0.5% increase in 2013,  Change in methodology: 5.6% increase in 2013, Change in boundary: 1.7% increase in 2012,  Other: 2.7% increase in 2012";"1932-int-S3-2008-2020-1";"intensity";"fin+"

We buy any additional energy required on the market. We are continuously working on the most energy-efficient raw material extraction and factory production.Goal: By 2030 we aim to reduce our specific carbon footprint for all electrical energy used at our production sites by 20% (2017 data: 302.51 kg CO2/MWh). This will entail making our energy conversion even more efficient, exploiting our potential from combined heat and power (CHP) generation to a greater extent and looking into using renewable sources of energy. The target concerns our Scope 1 and 2 emissions from own-use electricity, which are generated from direct energy conversion on the one hand and indirectly sourced electricity on the other.

Goal is to reduce the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by 10% from 2015 to 2020. This is measured by the electricity and greenhouse emissions intensity ratio per sq.m. including both communal and tenant areas. These ratios are normalised based on year of construction, vacancy, degree days and area and all electricity is 100% green.In 2017 ASR DCRF started collecting actual usage data from the individual units. The results for 2018 have not arrived yet, therefore the results below are focussing on the collective consumption only. The tenant data will be disclosed in the GRESB 2019 and the Fund's annual report 2020.Since 2015, the electricity intensity ratio decreased by 24% and the greenhouse gas intensity ratio by 55%. Water consumption decreased by 41% since 2016 and waste increased by 4% since 2017. The Fund's influence on the latter is relatively small since waste collection primarily is a municipal responsibility.The decreases show that the focus on its sustainable policy, acquisitions, maintenance and extensive sustainable renovation of the Fund's current portfolio have had a positive impact on the performance indicators. As soon as the tenant consumption is disclosed, the Fund will decide whether or not to sharpen its reduction targets within the ASR DCRF Three Year Businessplan 2020-2022.See for more info the annual fund report on https://en.asrrealestate.nl/media/214518/asr-dcrf-csr-annual-report-2018.pdf";NA;NA;"annual";5;0,6;2;2018;"2018-12-31";NA;NA;NA;NA;0;"C6 2019 S3.13";NA;NA;"-0ma-0e-0fb-0fb-0fb-0fb-0fa-7c-0zb-7f";NA;"68135-int-S3-2015-2020-2";"intensity";"fin+"

LTI is committed to enhancing the well-being of its Environment and our activities and achievements illustrate our efforts in this regard. Though, Business at LTI requires us to operate out of Office Spaces, we have taken up various Energy Conservation initiatives across all our offices in a phase-wise manner with least disturbances in day-to-day operations. We have taken up the following activities during the year in different phases:a. Replacing conventional Equipment with New Energy Efficient Equipment. b. HVAC Plant Optimisation,c. UPS Replacements and optimisation,d. Installation of LED Lights, Lighting Transformers, Motion Sensorse. Supplement electricity consumption with renewable or clean energy sources through Power Purchase Agreements.These initiatives have helped us achieve a reduction in electricity consumption to the tune of 8.5%. We have also achieved many milestones, from LEED Gold status for our headquarters in Powai by the US Green Building Council, Washington DC to taking up various initiatives on e-waste, energy consumption, water usage and waste disposal methods. These interventions were backed by persistent and proactive participation of LTIites. In FY 17-18, LTI has invested INR 21.4 million in energy conservation related projects which resulted in reducing 3,807 tonnes of carbon dioxide and an annual recurring energy saving of 2,126 Mwh.

Over three years ago, LTI launched a 'Go Green' initiative to sensitize employees to the importance of maintaining the ecological balance.
