The calculation of our emission reduction targets is based on the core policy scenario EUCO30. Moreover, we assume an improvement of energy efficiency and gas pipelines leading to a reduction on Scope 1 emissions by 1% annually and a 1% reduction of transmission and distribution losses of Scope 2 emissions. Scope 3 emissions will be reduced by increasing the share of renewable energy purchased and increasing the share of own generation of electricity from renewable energy sources. Under 2018 we released a new energy efficiency project: ''All E.ON premises carbon-neutral by 2030\". We updated the target to 2030 in order to be in line with the SDG timeframe and our climate strategy.Our direct and indirect carbon emissions totalled 69.06 million tonnes of CO2e in 2018, what represents a decline compared to previous year. This was mainly due to the lower Scope 3 emissions. Lower purchasing volumes, the purchase of less carbon-intensive materials and lower sales volumes of electricity and gas led to reductions and update emissions factors (e.g. for national grid factors and natural gas)2016 marked the starting point of measures and initiatives that will help us achieve our new climate-protection targets for 2030. However, year-on-year comparisons can be affected by fluctuations. A period of several years is necessary to determine whether our measures are effective and where we stand with regard to our targets.

We achieved a 21% reduction in 2018, exceeding our Vision 2020 goal, and will continue to evaluate and implement improvement projects.We operate more than 200 converting locations. Collectively, our converting operations emit approximately 1.1 million metric tons of GHG. Over time, emissions from our converting facilities have trended slightly downward by approximately 11 percent since 2010. Emissions from transporting product to converters are considered Scope 3 emissions and are not included in our reported GHG emissions. Our reported emissions do not include biogenic GHG emissions, which were 33.7 million metric tons in 2018. Through continuous improvements in operations, equipment, energy efficiency and fuel diversity, we were able to achieve significant company-wide GHG emission reductions. We have expanded our business while running with greater efficiency as shown by our energy efficiency improvement of 8.9% over 2010. Moreover, we have achieved a 46% decrease in other air emissions from our baseline year. This decrease is driven by both our efficiency efforts, regulatory requirements, and fuel switching away from coal and fuel oil to natural gas and biomass. We will continue to work with partners and increase efforts to reduce our emissions globally.We use the GHG Protocol for Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standards to inform our GHG goal accounting and reporting. Our emissions calculations for our current goal are global, and do not include joint ventures with non-operational control, biogenic CO2, or any acquisitions or divestitures that occurred during the reporting year. Baseline emission data recalculations are made annually to incorporate acquired facilities and take out divested facilities, which accounts for changes in emissions data reporting from year to this year. As such in 2018, as a result of the transfer of the North American Consumer Packaging Business, all current and prior year emissions data calculations have been adjusted to reflect this business as a discontinued operation.

We have decided to retain this target but are in the process of reviewing our environmental strategy to ensure our targets remain ambitious, acknowledging National Grids role in the transition to a net zero economy. A significant proportion of our emissions are driven by market conditions, energy demand and prevailing weather conditions giving us uncertainty in the short-term. GHG emissions for 2018/19 are around 1.4% higher than last year, primarily due to increased emissions from our US power generation business as a result of more deployment of our generation units. Though the dispatch is outside National Grid's control, the units are maintained to operate as efficiently and reliably as possible. National Grid utilises Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS) to monitor its generator emissions. We still continue to challenge each of our business units to make year on year reductions in emissions. National Grid is the electricity transmission owner and operator in the UK and parts of the North-eastern US. These systems have thermal losses (lost energy) resulting from the physical properties of the transmission cables. Losses from the transmission systems have previously been classified as Scope 3 indirect emissions. However, following guidance from the World Resources Institute these are now classified as Scope 2 emissions.";NA;NA;NA;42;0.238095238095238;1.33333333333333;2019;"2019-03-31";21630971;"C5.1 2018 S1, C5.1 2018 S2L";NA;NA;7012642;"C6 2019 S1, C6 2019 S2L";NA;NA;"-0fa-0fa-0fa-0za-7f-0zb-7f-0vk-0rec-0rcd-0rca-0rcd-0rec-0rec-0reb-0rec-5aa";"Base year emissions check: -0vk: stated base year emissions are 100% of calculated base year emissions (C5.1 2018 | TOTAL 21630971).; Organizational changes: Other: 0.14% increased in 2018,  Change in methodology: 0.0% decreased in 2018, Divestment: 0.0% decreased in 2017,  Change in methodology: 4.47% decreased in 2017,  Other: 0.55% decreased in 2017, Other: 3% decrease in 2016, Other: 5.4% decrease in 2015, Other: 1.81% increase in 2014";"12832-abs-S12L-1990-2050-1";"absolute"

Four million tonnes of CO2 are equal to the annual emissions from about one million cars.

The here presented target is based on the current lignite roadmap. The reduction target given above is up to 50% until 2030. According to the current lignite roadmap, electricity generation from lignite and therefore the associated emissions will have ceased entirely by the middle of the cen-tury.In detail: By 2020 compared to base year, we will have reduced our emissions produced in the generation of electricity from lignite by around 15% as a result of so-called security standby. Emissions will continue to fall up to 2030 owing to the decline in the number of operational hours in the wake of expanding renewable energy, efficiency enhancements, additional modernisation of our power plant portfolio and by discontinuation of the Inden opencast mine and the associated shutdown of the Weisweiler lignite-fired power plant. The resultant fall in emissions by 2030 will then be a total of up to 50%.With regard to hard coal we anticipate further CO2 reductions in our power plant portfolio. This results by the shutdown of our Gersteinwerk power station (beginning of 2019). In the Netherlands we are partly replacing hard coal for firing our power plants with biomass.

We implement energy and GHG reduction projects, we share best practices in energy management among our operations to achieve our goals and we contribute to global efforts to reduce emissions by advocating for carbon pricing. We have also set goals that drive investment in lower-carbon and alternative energy generation, including investments that ultimately contribute to the transition to a low-carbon economy.

From that forecast, our actual 2015 emissions were 22% lower than anticipated. Based on our 2015 emissions, this translated to a 1% absolute reduction from 2010.

In 2015, four years ahead of schedule, Equinor achieved this goal, and therefore the company raised its target by 50 percent to 1.2 million tonnes the same year.Our new contribution to the Konkraft target was set in 2016.
