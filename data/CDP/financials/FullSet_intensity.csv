This is disappointing since we know that the underlying carbon efficiency of our plants has improved far more.Our carbon footprint for steel has reduced by 21% since 2007 - even though over this period the share of our production from the integrated route has increased from 77% to 83%, in response to changes in structural market demand. So, even though we are making more steel in this way, any increase in emissions has been more than outweighed due to improvements in the technical carbon efficiency of our steel plants. As a result, we have managed to achieve a relatively constant average carbon intensity since 2007. Today this stands at 2.12 tonnes of CO2 per tonne steel.Our efforts are now focused on building a roadmap to underpin a new medium-term 2030 target, which will be based on further technical efficiencies and the application of our portfolio of breakthrough technologies to reduce emissions.

Our total carbon dioxide emissions mostly originate from heating and cooling our properties with district heating and district cooling and from visitors coming to our retail hubs by car. One property that was acquired in 2017 also requires high amounts of process cooling. A very small proportion is from electricity consumption at the properties or business trips. Our carbon dioxide emissions amounted to a total of 7.5 kg CO2e/square meter in 2018, which is an increase on the previous year (6.7 kg /sq.m), but still a decrease since our base year (8.0 kg /sq.m). In 2018 the use of heating decreased, but the use of cooling increased more as a result of the hot summer. Carbon dioxide emissions from using district heating and their environmental load depend partly on the fuel that our district heating suppliers use. In the case of district heating and district cooling, we rely on the local supplier at each location, and environmental performance varies a great deal. We are working to reach the targets by energy efficiency projects and in other ways reducing the amount of purchased energy per square meter as well as by using low carbon energy. In 2018, the electricity we used and that we supplied to our tenants was renewable and carbon dioxide-free. This comprised of hydroelectric power with a guarantee of origin with the Golden standard. We used certified carbon dioxide-free electricity at all of our properties, except for one. To compensate for this we supported a wind power project in India.

Recognizing the need to express the footprint of our operations in a meaningful way, Bell has established an intensity emissions target to reduce the ratio of our emissions to our network usage by 75% of 2014 level by the end of 2020. As a recognized environmental leader, Bell is also working on a new approach to setting emission-reduction objectives using a science-based (SB) methodology. We are in the process of determining how such SB objectives could be achievable in Bell's operations. This is an ambitious endeavour that we expect to conclude some time by 2025. In the interim, Bell continues implementing mitigation measures (MM) that seek to reduce our energy & fuel consumption, and therefore minimize our annual GHG emissions. In addition, Bell has long understood that the use of its P&S helps fight climate change by reducing the carbon footprint within our operations, and especially those of our customers. We support the findings of Global eSustainability Initiative's SMARTer2030 report, which estimated that widespread deployment of information and communications technologies (ICT) could save up to 10 times the carbon emissions generated by the ICT sector itself by 2030. Given that the variation in our absolute emissions does not capture the carbon reduction enabling capabilities of our P&S for our customers, we have decided to establish our emissions reduction target on an intensity basis rather than in absolute terms. Moreover, the nature of the ICT industry combined with our sustainable business growth make it very difficult to achieve meaningful absolute emissions reductions within our operations. Still, the expected combined effect of the growth of our business, the MM to be implemented and the anticipated decrease in electricity emission factors due to grid mix decarbonisation could lead to a 3.7% decrease in absolute Scope 1+2 emissions by the end of 2020 compared to 2014.

This equates to a 15.4% reduction against our 2020 goal since our FY15 baseline (FY15 scope 1 and 2 emissions = 122,520 tons CO2). With (revised) group intensity at 0.18g of CO2e per unit produced in 2015 the target was 0.144g of CO2e per unit produced. In FY16 Brambles achieved 0.21g per unit produced.

The details of that GHG reduction target commitment are as follows: by the end of 2020, Broadridge will reduce its Scope 1 + Scope 2 emissions total by 7.5% from its 2013 baseline emissions level, on an absolute GHG emissions basis. Also by the end of 2020, Broadridge will reduce its Scope 1 + Scope 2 total GHG emissions intensity by 30% from its 2013 baseline emissions levels, on an intensity basis of total Scope 1 + Scope 2 GHG emissions per $ Million of revenue. After the first six (6) years of this seven (7) year target commitment program, Broadridge's performance progress as of this 2019 CDP report has achieved the absolute GHG emissions reduction target commitment, ahead of schedule, with an emissions intensity reduction of 41.2% from 2013 to 2019. This target's early achivement was due to implementation of numerous energy efficiency and energy use reduction projects over the last 6 years; corporate streamlining/operational efficiency improvements from consolidating major printing operations after a large acquisition made at the beginning of 2017; and closing a captive Broadridge data center in FY2018 and shifting those operations to an existing contracted data host. Based on this performance success, in FY2020 Broadridge will be evaluating options for setting a new, long-term GHG emissions intensity reduction target, as part of its expanding program for climate change and carbon management.";NA;NA;NA;6;0.666666666666667;4.28571428571429;2019;"2019-04-30";73288;"C5.1 2019 S1, C5.1 2019 S2L";NA;NA;55529;"C6 2019 S1, C6 2019 S2L";NA;NA;"-0ca-0fa-0e-0fa-7a-0za-7f-0zb-7f-0reb-0reb";"Organizational changes: Other: 7.9% decreased in 2018, Other: 17.7% decreased in 2017";"2326-int-S12L-2013-2020-1";"intensity"

During this time frame CP successfully reduced greenhouse gas intensity from operations of the locomotive fleet exceeding the 7.2% reduction target. The new target described in this section builds upon this achievement and represents a multi-year (5 total) greenhouse gas intensity reduction initiative. For CP, this target only includes scope 1 emissions, however, locomotive emissions account for greater than 94% of all CP emissions.Canadian Pacific has made a significant contribution to environmental sustainability in the past and it is well positioned to play an important role in the future. In an effort to proactively manage locomotive emissions, the Rail Association of Canada and its member railways (including Canadian Pacific) entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with Transport Canada and Environment Canada. Under this agreement, the rail industry committed to greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets, on an intensity basis as well as efforts to reduce emissions of criteria air contaminants. First executed in 2005, the latest agreement recognizes and builds on the success of the three previous memoranda between the RAC and the Government of Canada. The GHG emissions target outlined in the new MOU requires Class 1 railways to reduce Locomotive GHG emissions intensity by 6% from 2017 levels by the end of 2022. Based on the 6% reduction, the target emission intensity for the end of 2022 for CP is 11.35 kg CO2e/1,000 Revenue ton-kilometers .CP remains committed to the objectives of the MOU and continues to demonstrate leadership in operating one of the most fuel efficient Class 1 freight railways in North America.

Assim percebemos que cada nova loja de 1.950 m que nao apresente emissoes representa uma ampliacao de 513,6 tCO2e na base calculo da meta, o que equivale ao vazamento de 285 kg de R-22, desse modo cada nova loja possui o efeito de compensar as emissoes de uma loja media afetada por vazamentos.

The 10% reduction shown in the question above is the average of this range, which will narrow over time. The intensity baseline is based on our operations at the start of 2017 (not including Marine, Aviation, and Exploration from Gulf of Mexico and Senegal). Our performance will be based on estimated gross operated greenhouse gas emissions, stated in CO2e, divided by our gross operated production, stated in barrels of oil equivalent. The target is set in relation to our gross operated emissions as these are the emissions over which we have the most control. The target applies to both Scope 1 emissions and Scope 2 emissions. We report our operated emissions in the following regions, countries and provinces in accordance with regulation: Australia , European Union, Norway, United Kingdom, Alberta, Canada, British Columbia, Canada, Indonesia and United States. See http://www.conocophillips.com/sustainability/managing-climate-related-risks/metrics-targets/ghg-emissions/ for more information. There are similarities in the way that we have framed the target to the way the Paris Agreement has been framed. The Paris process uses 'Nationally Determined Contributions' (NDCs) to set interim performance targets that are reviewed on a five-year basis to move toward achieving the agreement's objective. We intend to review and adjust our performance target in a similar way. Science-Based Targets require us to include Scope 3 emissions. For E&P companies, the emissions from use of sold products is not in the scope of our control and leads to significant double-counting. In terms of specific methodology, the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach has not developed a methodology for the energy sector. The 100% of target achieved reflects the fact that our 2018 GHG intensity, calculated with the same methodology as our baseline, exceeds a 10% intensity reduction. The 2017 sale of older assets in the U.S. and Canada reduced our GHG emissions intensity significantly. However, we set the target for 2030 to encourage the integration of climate risk management into long-term planning and decision-making, as our operations and portfolio will continue to change.

Alongside a focus on increasing the proportion of renewable energies, which has already been a key performance indicator in the environment goal dimension for managing the company for many years, the inclusion of the new key performance indicator CO2 intensity reflects the special importance of climate change as a social, political and also economic challenge for EnBW.The calculation basis for the key performance indicator CO2 intensity is the amount of CO2 emissions from own generation of electricity for the Group, as well as the volume of electricity generated by the Group without the contribution made by the nuclear power plants. This performance indicator is calculated as the ratio between the emissions and the generated volume of electricity and thus specifically describes the amount of CO2 released per kilowatt hour. By discounting the electricity generated by nuclear power plants, the performance indicator will not be influenced by the phasing out of nuclear energy in the coming years. The goal of EnBW is to contribute actively to climate protection by successively reducing the CO2 intensity of its own generation of electricity (excluding nuclear power) by 15 to 20% by 2020 compared to 606 g/kWh in the reference year 2015. In 2018 the CO2 intensity of own generation of electricity excluding nuclear power fell in comparison to the previous year by 0.5% to 553 g/kWh.

In 2018, the relative indicator for this target was 0,000575705 tCO2e/kg, and the target to 2025 is to mantain at least a 10% reduction in comparison to the base year (0,000639673 tCO2e/kg). Thus, it is considered that the target has been achieved (100%), even though it is status \"revised\" because it is under review (since there is no option that best describes this case).";NA;NA;"Brazil (breakdown matches)";8;0.125;0.769230769230769;2018;"2018-12-31";289810.1;"C5.1 2019 S1";NA;NA;216785.77;"C6 2019 S1";NA;NA;"-0ca-0e-0e-0fb-0za-7gb-0zb-7gb-0ta-0rab-0rcb-0rea-0rcb-0rbd-0rce-0rce-0rec-0rce-0rea-0rea-0rac-7h";"Found keyword(s): Brazil; Organizational changes: Acquisitions: 14.25% increased in 2018, Acquisitions: 2.16% increased in 2017,  Other: 12.5% increased in 2017, Acquisitions: 3.4% increase in 2016,  Change in methodology: 21.76% decrease in 2016,  Change in boundary: 0.13% increase in 2016, Change in boundary: 3.15% decrease in 2015,  Other: 1.6% decrease in 2015, Change in boundary: 2.28% increase in 2014,  Other: 28% increase in 2014, Other: 32.2% increase in 2013,  Mergers: 5.6% increase in 2013";"9577-int-S1-2012-2025-1";"intensity"

The fuel conservation targets are set for actual quantities of fuel, but the actual quantities of fuel burned are a function of rail traffic, which varies from year to year. Therefore, we are reporting an intensity target. KCS sets a rolling annual target for locomotive fuel conservation for its locomotives, which represent 98.78 percent of its total Scope 1 GHG emissions. The figures discussed here are for locomotive diesel fuel use only. For CY 2018, actual fuel consumption was 135.8 million gallons.

This project was started in 2004, when we changed a oil for natural GAS in Piracibaba unit. Then in 2008 we changed 2 to Heavy oil Boilers for a Biomass boiler in Monte Alegre Mill and did the same action in Otacilio Costa mill (2014), Correia Pinto mill (2012) and Angatuba mill (2015). With the improvements made in our processes, in 2018 we reached the target value until the year 2022, obtaining the result of 178.68 kgCO2eq per ton of product. We reduced the consumption of non-renewable fuels for energy generation by 7%, mainly from actions to reduce the consumption of fuel oil (-12% compared to 2017) and diesel (-31% compared to 2017).To reaffirm our commitment to implementing actions to combat climate change, Klabin is the first Brazilian company in the sector of forests, pulp and paper to be part of the \"Companies Taking Action\" initiative of the validation of our goals based on Science Based Targets.Science-based targets provide companies with a clearly defined pathway to future-proof growth by specifying how much and how quickly they need to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.";NA;NA;"Brazil, Angatuba, Correia Pinto, Monte Alegre, Otacilio Costa (breakdown matches)";6;0.333333333333333;3.46666666666667;2018;"2018-12-31";642219;"C5.1 2019 S1, C5.1 2019 S2M";NA;NA;705400.95;"C6 2019 S1, C6 2019 S2M";NA;NA;"-0ca-0fa-0fa-0fa-0fa-0da-0db-7a-0zb-7f-0ta-0tc-0rab-0rab-0rcd-0rad";"Found keyword(s): Brazil, Angatuba, Correia Pinto, Monte Alegre, Otacilio Costa; Organizational changes: Acquisitions: 8.0% increased in 2017, Acquisitions: 33.62% increase in 2016, Change in methodology: 1.27% decrease in 2015, Change in methodology: 8% increase in 2014";"10202-int-S12M-2004-2022-1";"intensity"

For more than a century the majority of electrical energy has been generated with carbon-based fuels. Transitioning to a decarbonized generation resource mix is a long and expensive undertaking. However, APS has been moving toward a lower carbon position for many years. For example, from 2006 through 2016 we added over one gigawatt of solar nameplate capacity to our system, becoming the only electric utility outside of California to achieve this milestone. And by the end of 2017 our system had over 1,600 megawatts of renewables of which approximately 1,300 megawatts came from solar resources.In line with projected population growth in Arizona, we anticipate customer growth of approximately 45 percent by 2032, representing up to an additional 549,000 customers. We expect renewable energy and energy efficiency to meet more than 50 percent of that growth, along with a planned reduction of coal generation from 21 percent in 2017 to 11 percent of the APS generation mix by 2032 .This will help us achieve our long-term goal to reduce our carbon-emission rate to less than 600 pounds per megawatt-hour (lb/MWh) by 2032.APS has been exploring and working with the SBT framework to set a target and has not aligned at this time with a scenario that best meets our growing load and still remaining clean, reliable, and affordable.

Red Electrica undertakes to reduce its Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 40 % per MWh transported by 2030 compared to 2015 figures. This relative target translates into a commitment to reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 30 % for the year 2030 with respect to 2015, having approved a previous emissions reduction target of 10 % for 2020 with respect to that same year.REE 2030 target includes transmission losses (95% of Scope 1+Scope2 in base year). It is important to explain that REE, as the operator of the electricity system cannot make decisions regarding the main factors that affects energy losses. Losses mainly depend on the geographical location units with respect to consumption areas, the generation mix, the size of the grid, the international power exchanges, the voltage level and the demand curve. The assessment of generation is based on market rules and performed by an independent body (not REE). REE must comply with operational procedures defined by the regulator (mandatory procedures) and according to them, it is not possible to operate the system with an energy losses reduction criteria. For this reason, it is very difficult for REE to establish targets to reduce emissions from energy losses. Nevertheless, REE has considered losses in the general targets, in order to be in accordance with SBTi criteria and to stress its commitment and ambition towards climate change and energy transition. REE has a crucial role in renewable energy integration and REE's activity is needed to increase the % of renewable energy in the energy mix. The % of achieved target is expected to be more relevant in the second part of the target period because a huge increase in the renewable energy is expected to be integrated in the electricity system in order to fulfil European targets. Due to this increase, the emission factor of Spanish generation mix is expected to decrease significantly in the next years.";NA;NA;NA;13;0.0769230769230769;2.66666666666667;2018;"2018-12-31";1176028.81;"C5.1 2019 S1, C5.1 2019 S2M";NA;NA;1156678.85;"C6 2019 S1, C6 2019 S2M";NA;NA;"-0fb-7a-0za-7ga-0zb-7f-0rec-0rce-0rce-0rcd";"Organizational changes: Other: 0.88% increased in 2018,  Change in boundary: 0.06% increased in 2018, Change in boundary: 0.08% increase in 2016,  Change in methodology: 0.22% decrease in 2016";"15459-int-S12M-2015-2030-1";"intensity"

Scope 1 and 2 emissions cover all the company's global property energy and vehicle fuel consumption. The scope 3 emissions relate to this consumption and cover electricity transmission and distribution losses, and well to tank emissions for scope 1 property energy and vehicle fuel. The emissions data has been adjusted for 2015-2018 to take account of the very large divestment of European workwear operations (excluding those in France and UK), which had previously accounted for a large percentage of the company's property fuel consumption. This divestment took the form of a joint venture with Haniel to form CWS-boco in which the company had less than 20% shareholding, and, as such, did not continue to have operational control of these businesses.At the same time the company has been pursuing a significant level of acquisitions, and this will continue until 2020, which will result in an increased level of absolute emissions over the period covered by the target. The figures given below for % anticipated change are for absolute emissions, and include the effect of this extensive acquisition programme undertaken since 2015 (revenues at constant exchange rates have increased by 40.3% in the period 2015-2018).The company also reports on emissions resulting from its use of Sulfuryl Fluoride. The gas is used in large fumigation contracts against pests like termites. Consequently, there are year-on-year customer demand driven variabilities in emissions. For 2018, absolute emissions derived from use of Sulfuryl Fluoride are 363,339 tonnes (2017: 481,390 tonnes; 2016: 720,322 tonnes; 2015: 612,310 tonnes; and 2014: 850,883 tonnes), which indicates the variability in customer demand. Studies indicate there is no suitable fumigation alternative to Sulfuryl Fluoride approved currently by regulatory authorities. Emissions due to the company's use of Sulfuryl Fluoride are not included with the company's intensity target.";"Possible % achieved issue";NA;"France (breakdown matches)";4;0.5;4;2018;"2018-12-31";244376;"DWH 2017 S1, DWH 2017 S2L, DWH 2016 S3.01, DWH 2016 S3.02, DWH 2016 S3.03, DWH 2016 S3.04: upstream completeness: 0.666666666666667";198979;"C5.1 2019 S1, C5.1 2019 S2L";233513;"C6 2019 S1, C6 2019 S2L, C6 2019 S3.03: upstream completeness: 1";NA;NA;"-0hb-0e-0fa-0e-0fa-7a-7c-0zb-7f-0ta-0rab-0rcb-2ea";"Found keyword(s): France; Organizational changes: Acquisitions: 26.0% increased in 2017, Acquisitions: 3.5% increase in 2016";"15675-int-S12L3-2015-2020-1";"intensity"

During the reporting year, we decreased the gCO2 per parcel by 6.6 per cent. Since the target was introduced in 2013, we have reduced the gCO2 per parcel by 56 per cent, against the original IPC target of 20 per cent. We are transforming from a letters company that delivers parcels, to a parcels company that delivers letters. As the UK's pre-eminent parcel delivery company with over 50 per cent of market share by volume, we are having to accommodate more and bigger parcels than ever before. This places increasing demand on our fleet and fuel consumption. In contrast to letters, parcel volumes are forecast to grow over the period covered by the target.

By 2050, our ambition is to align Shell's NCF with the footprint of the energy mix in the global energy system. We aim to reduce the NCF of the energy products we sell (in grams of CO2 equivalent per megajoule consumed) by around 50% by 2050.Early 2019, Shell decided to set a NCF target for 2021 of 2-3% lower than our 2016 NCF of 79 grams of CO2 equivalent per megajoule. This energy transition condition is included in performance conditions for the 2019 long-term incentive plan grant. It will include the first three-year target to reduce the NCF of the energy products we sell and will also include other measures that will help us achieve our strategic ambitions in the long term, related to the growth of Shell's Power business, commercialising opportunities in advanced biofuel technology and development of systems to capture and store carbon.The energy transition condition applies to Executive Directors, Executive Committee members and around 150 of Shell's senior executives in 2019.NOTE:- Non-energy products outside of NCF scope include chemical feedstocks or products, lubricants and bitumen.- The ''% of emissions in scope\" is estimated based on our total emissions including full life cycle emissions from them. Their end-of-life assumptions align with description in sector ''End of life treatment of sold products\" category.- In the box ''% change anticipated in absolute Scope 1/2/3 emissions\", we reflect on our NCF intensity target of a 2-3% reduction by 2021 (not absolute emissions). Our NCF Ambition is not an absolute emission target. The \"Net Carbon Footprint\" is also not a mathematical derivation of total emissions divided by total energy. It is a weighted average aggregation of lifecycle CO2 intensities of different energy products normalizing them to the same point relative to their final end-use.Please find details at: https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/what-is-shells-net-carbon-footprint-ambition/faq.html";NA;NA;NA;2;-0.5;0.4;2018;"2018-12-31";81000000;"C5.1 2018 S1, C5.1 2018 S2M";NA;NA;82000000;"C6 2019 S1, C6 2019 S2M";NA;NA;"-6c-0cb-0hb-0fb-0fb-0fb-0fb-0fb-0rcd-0rcb-0rec-0rce-0rca-0rce-0rca-0rcb-0rcd-0rec-6fn";"Missing info: % change anticipated in absolute Scope 1+2 emissions, % change anticipated in absolute Scope 3 emissions; Organizational changes: Change in methodology: 0.7% decreased in 2018,  Acquisitions: 1.7% increased in 2018,  Other: 1.0% increased in 2018,  Change in boundary: 1.4% decreased in 2018,  Divestment: 4.4% decreased in 2018, Change in boundary: 1.8% decreased in 2017,  Divestment: 2.4% decreased in 2017,  Acquisitions: 4.1% increased in 2017,  Change in methodology: 0.2% decreased in 2017,  Other: 2.4% increased in 2017";"16012-int-S12M3-2016-2021-1";"intensity"

The intensity ratio covers the total output from SSE's thermal (oil, gas, coal, multifuel) and renewable (wind, both onshore and offshore, hydro including pumped storage and biomass) electricity generation portfolio.Performance against the target: SSE's target is to reduce the carbon intensity of the electricity it generates by 50% by 2030, based on 2018 levels. This means that SSE's electricity generation carbon intensity is now forecast to be around 150gCO2e/kWh by 2030, which represents a 75% cut based on its original 2006 baseline.Between 2017/18 and 2018/19 the carbon intensity of SSE's generated electricity fell by 7% from 305gCO2e/kWh to 284gCO2e/kWh, as a result of changes in its generation output mix. SSE had a record year of renewable generation output and this, combined with a reduction in the coal-fired and gas- and oil-fired generation output, resulted in the reduction in carbon intensity.It is important to note that SSE does not expect the achievement of this target in 2030 to have followed a linear year-to-year reduction path. Market driven and weather related fluctuations may mean there are some years in which emissions may increase. However, SSE fully expects to achieve its 2030 target and the long-term trend continues to be significant reduction in the carbon intensity of the electricity it generates.This is a science based target. The science based target was assessed using SSE's internal model based on the UK government's Climate Change Act 2008 ambitions.

The difference in percentages (81% emissions in scope and 90% relative fuel consumption) is due to the fact that our paper mill network is highly self sufficient and has a lower usage of electricity from the grid compared to the converting operations, which are higher in using scope 2 energy. At our paper mills, when producing our own heat and power, we can reach over 90% efficiency of the fuel energy value compared to the electricity produced to the grid (30-60% efficiency). We have significantly invested in best practice in paper mills and the Combined Heat and Power plants built on our sites are highly relevant for the emission reductions we have achieved since 2010.

Emission intensity at Jamshedpur Works improved by 0.5% in FY19 (2.30 t/tcs in FY18 and 2.29 t/tcs in FY19). The combined emission intensity, therefore for two integrated steel plants at Jamshedpur & Kalinganagar is 2.346 tCO2/tcs in FY19. Therefore, %reduction of emission intensity achieved over baseline = 100 x (1-2.346/3.124) = 24.9%.

Hence, the sources of emissions and absolute emissions of FY05 represents a fraction of current operations.

CO2 targets (WSA scopes 1-3) cover 100% of steelmaking representing the majority (97%) of total TSE emissions. The target is to match or better the highest 15% performers in the sector in 5-year. Rather, than fixing the target at the start of the 5-year period, it is set at the start of each FY in accordance with the most recently published World Steel report. This considers global trends in the steel and commodity markets that influence operational and CO2 performance e.g. demand (influencing production volume), scrap vs iron ore price, (influencing scrap ratio), ore/coal quality vs price and relative energy prices. Operating at pre-defined feedstock / volumes independent of such trends would put the company at an untenable competitive disadvantage.For two European integrated sites, FY19 intensity was 2.00 t/tcs (target of 1.83 t/tcs) i.e. 4.59% increase against target reduction of 4.36% against baseline (target compliance = -4.59/4.36 x 100 = -105.4%). Absolute emissions reduced by 4.4% compared to baseline.Contributory factors to the intensity increase vs the baseline year:a) total recycled scrap reduced from 0.216 t/tcs to 0.168 t/tcs i.e. by 22%, requiring more virgin iron to be producedb) steel volume reduced by 8.6 %, meaning fixed losses were spread across a smaller product volumec) operational issues, planned (for example an extended BF refurbishment at Port Talbot) and unplanned outages, leading to sub-optimal operation.TSE's emission reduction program (refer to CC3.3a) focuses on scope 1 & 2 emissions with minor impact on scope 3. Thus target % reduction in scope 1+2 emissions exceeds that for scope 1 to 3. Direction of change are based on pragmatic assumption that production volume and composition of burden (ore, coal, scrap etc.) remain unchanged, such that CO2 emissions are affected only by implementation of reduction projects and process stability/control. The state of steel market and that of the raw materials we buy have a strong influence on this assumption. Steelmaking operations in Europe are highly optimized and approaching thermodynamic limits.

In 2017 the emissions total increased for the first time since the establishment of the Company's target. This was is due to an increase in data coverage and accuracy. In the 2018 reporting cycle, emissions were incorporated into the portfolio from a significant acquisition, which resulted in a 40% increase in Thermo Fisher's emissions year-over-year when normalized by revenue. In this situation we have used the guidance set forth in the GHG Protocol's Chapter 5 to recalculate historic data for a meaningful and consistent comparison over time. When Patheon's 2017 emissions are added to Thermo Fisher then compared year-over-year with 2018 totals, combined emissions were reduced by 1% and when normalized by revenue the total year-over-year CO2 emissions reduction was 10% in 2018. The decision was made to not retroactively recalculate all four years of GhG emissions reporting due to these factors: The quality of emissions reporting since 2015 has improved substantially and there is only one year remaining in the current reduction target timeline.

We are committed to continuously reducing the environmental impact of our own operations, which includes our manufacturing plants, distribution centers, service centers, offices, fleets and other operations worldwide. We look across the lifecycle of our business, including emissions upstream, within our global operations and downstream. Our emissions reduction strategies include improving energy efficiency, using renewable energy (either on-site or off-site), tracking and managing emissions using information technology, and exploring how demand response, energy storage, and other new technologies can continue to help us manage our emissions.

Since 2012, with our increasing coverage of our Environmental Management System and our energy efficiency initiatives we have managed to decrease our emission intensity by 66% (It was 56% in 2016 and 60.2 in 2017).Total yearly GHG emissions in tCO2e reported under Scope 1 and 2 of the GHG Includes GHG emissions (CO2 , CH4 and N2 O and f-gases) from energy consumption from fossil fuel sources for heating, generators, leased vehicle fleet in commercial use and refrigerants for Scope 1, and purchased electricity by Garanti BBVA's operations in Turkey (Headquarters, service buildings, branches and ATMs) for Scope 2.. Scope 3 emissions are not included within the scope of our intensity target. IPCC Fifth Assessment Report factors are used for global warming potentials and emission factors. Grid Emission Factor is calculated based on the most recent data available by TEIAS. GHG emissions are reported following the guidance in GRI 305-1 Direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Scope 1), GRI 305-2 Energy indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Scope 2) and the GHG Protocol - Location-based.

We can only calculate the anticipated change in absolute terms for scope 1 and 2 as an intensity target has only been identified for these scopes. Total Net Rev (2017-2018): 12,247.55 Crore Total Projected Net Rev based on an estimated 25% year-on-year increase (2022-2023): 37,376.55 Crore The emissions intensity target per Net Revenue (in Cr.) for 2022-2023 is 3.63 MT Co2e/Net Rev (Crores), and the expected Scope 1+2 emissions for 2017-2018 is 3.63 * 37,376.55 = 135,818.61The % anticipated change in emissions has thus been calculated as follows: (Expected emissions - Base Year Emissions) / Base Year Emissions *100 = ((135,818.61 - 63578.63)/63578.63)*100 = 114%Absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions are thus expected to increase by 114% by the target year as a result of the exponential growth of the Bank's business and operations.";NA;NA;NA;5;0;6;2019;"2019-03-31";63578.63;"C5.1 2019 S1, C5.1 2019 S2L";NA;NA;66207.35;"C6 2019 S1, C6 2019 S2L";NA;NA;"-0e-0e-0fb-0fa-0fb-0fb-7a-0zb-7f";NA;"22188-int-S12L-2018-2023-1";"intensity"

To achieve this goal, Walmart is launching Project Gigaton - an opportunity for suppliers and organizations to join Walmart in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the supply chain.For promoting project Gigaton, we are using RedE platform from 2018, which is providing us online monitoring engines for setting targets and implementing results, guidelines, etc. Apart from it, Epic group audited all the facilities by recognized third party and energy auditors.

In this respect, we look at least to 2020 to maintain our objective of not increase our emissions. This is aligned with the 2 degrees objectives since on one hand the company has achieved and is expected to continue to achieve double-digit growth, whereas our emissions ambition is to cap at 2009 levels. On top of this, Amadeus invests 18% of its revenues in R&D and this helps airlines and other customers to meet their own scope 1 and 2 targets.We aim at stabilizing our absolute emissions. Given the company's continuous growth, in practical terms, this target requires that we improve our intensity performance. Since we don't know the growth of the company in advance, our target is to at least maintain the same performance as last year. In order to measure our emissions performance, we have developed a system that factors in company growth to assign varying weights to absolute and intensity targets according to company growth. This process assigns more weight to absolute targets when the company grows slowly or remains stable, and the system assigns more weight to intensity targets when the company grows fast.Before 2018, we reported the emissions of our top sites included in our Environmental Management System (EMS). This represented the emissions of approximately 70% of our workforce and of our Data Center. From 2018 onwards, we have reported both the emissions obtained thought direct reporting (70% of workforce + Data Center) and have also included the estimation of the emissions from the remaining 30% of workforce that was not included in our reporting before 2018). This new methodology has been validated by our external verification company KPMG.Analyzing in more detail our performance, we have reduced scope 1+2 emissions per employee by 59.85% (1.807 tons CO2 per employee) in the reporting year compared to the year before (2017). This is particularly remarkable considering that we have expanded our coverage and if we consider the base year, we also reduced this ratio by 72.66%, so it shows a very positive trend. This calculation includes the deduction of 16,410 tons of CO2 of our scope 2 emissions that have been offset by Amadeus using UNFCCC CERs.

RTK is a standard aviation efficiency metric and is defined as the utilised (sold) capacity for passengers and cargo expressed in metric tonnes, multiplied by the distance flown. For transparency, each year we also report in full our CO2e from aircraft fuel use and our CO2 per passenger km in our sustainability report. This target covers 99.9% of scope 1 emissions. 10 years into our target period, we've reduced the CO2 per RTK by 18.1% from 0.869 kgCO2/RTK to 0.712 kgCO2/RTK. RTK calculates passengers and freight flown, multiplied by the Great Circle Distances (GCD), airport to airport distance. The GCD is multiplied by 8% to allow for 'real world' distances flown, e.g. sub-optimal routing and stacking at airports during periods of heavy congestion. Though there is still some way to go to meet our target, we have not yet completed our fleet renewal. We added three 787 in 2018, and 12 A350s will be switched into our fleet by the end of 2021; each aircraft will be on average 30% more fuel efficient than the aircraft it replaces. This along with more efficient flight procedures and increasing load factors should help us get close to reaching our target in 2021. Variables such as aircraft orders, load factors and growth make estimation prone to uncertainty.

This is an annual target, where we look to improve our efficiency each year by at least 1.5% relative to the previous year. Unfortunately, in 2018 our efficiency measure was very similar to the 2017 value (0.711 kg vs 0.712kg). This is a very slight decrease in our efficiency. Like other airlines, we experienced supply issues with the Rolls Royce Trent 1000 engine on our 787-9 aircraft. This meant we had to make changes to our flying programme to support additional engine maintenance activity. On average this resulted in two of our most fuel efficient planes being parked each month. At the same time, to ensure continuity of service for our customers, we delayed retirement of older, less efficient aircraft and introduced four additional A330-200s into our fleet. This resulted in our static efficiency results in 2018. However is it worth noting that if we calculate our overall emission intensity reductions since 2009 we are ahead of where the IATA target would require us to be in 2020.

With respect to this baseline and due to factors related to the national energy matrices and the projects started by 2018, the Company has managed to achieve 183 ton CO2e/GWh. Additionally, in general terms, all of Celsia's operations have reduced their GHG emissions by around 44% in the three scopes.The reduction percentage of the emission intensity in 2018 compared to the base year was 53%. This was mainly due to the proportion of hydroelectric power generation in the national energy matrix of 2018 because of the hydroclimatological conditions, which increased the contributions from the water sources and as a result, reduced the generation of the thermal power plants and therefore, the Organization's greenhouse gas emissions.Celsia is achieving the targets established in 2016 both in absolute terms and intensity.

The reduction goal represents the intent of current and future energy consumption reduction initiatives and currently does not consider available offsets or RECs. The initial goal is to reduce overall consumption without offsetting through RECs, although the use of RECs and offsets may be employed at a future date. The emissions scope includes all company electric and natural gas usage; employed for facility operations and process energy in our manufacturing facilities and administrative buildings. The emissions scope additionally includes all emissions from our company owned transportation/delivery fleet and our operations/admin ground fleet. Excluded from the scope are fugitive emissions and emissions from our privately owned wood burning boilers. Boiler emissions are excluded from scope 1 emissions because they utilize bio-based wood waste as fuel.During 2016 we met our intensity target of 25% emissions reduction. We used a baseline of 2009 and had a goal of reaching this by 2019. This required us to set a new goal this year and we have decided to use the 2016 emissions numbers as our new baseline. In 2016 our MTCO2e per $1000 in Sales was 0.1685 and in 2017 it was 0.1436. We had a large increase in sales while reducing our absolute emissions. This resulted in a large single year drop in normalized emissions of 14.8%. We do not expect this large of a decrease every year as generally our emissions will increase as sales, and resulting energy usage, increases.

The Government proposed in its Consultation Document in 2015 that fuel mix with 50% gas, 25% nuclear and 25% coal and RE. We have started to construct a new gas fired unit, L10, at Lamma Power Station (LPS) in 2016. With higher efficiency, L10 will emit ~ 25% less CO2 than an existing older gas-fired unit at LPS, for the same amount of electricity generated. In September 2016, the Government gave us the green light for the construction of another gas-fired generating unit, L11. This unit will replace an ageing, less efficient gas-fired unit scheduled to retire in 2022.

We decreased our overall absolute emissions compared to 2015 by approximately 70,000 tonnes of CO2-e, but also decreased our total gross lettable area (GLA) due to divestment of several assets.Target setting (both absolute and intensity) is a key component of our portfolio-wide approach to continuous environmental improvement and achieving the 'Low carbon smart assets' pillar of Vicinity's Sustainability strategy.

We have taken up the following activities during the year in different phases:a. Replacing conventional Equipment with New Energy Efficient Equipment. b. HVAC Plant Optimisation,c. UPS Replacements and optimisation,d. Installation of LED Lights, Lighting Transformers, Motion Sensorse. Supplement electricity consumption with renewable or clean energy sources through Power Purchase Agreements.These initiatives have helped us achieve a reduction in electricity consumption to the tune of 8.5%. We have also achieved many milestones, from LEED Gold status for our headquarters in Powai by the US Green Building Council, Washington DC to taking up various initiatives on e-waste, energy consumption, water usage and waste disposal methods. These interventions were backed by persistent and proactive participation of LTIites. In FY 17-18, LTI has invested INR 21.4 million in energy conservation related projects which resulted in reducing 3,807 tonnes of carbon dioxide and an annual recurring energy saving of 2,126 Mwh.
