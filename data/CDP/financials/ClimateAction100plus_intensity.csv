This is disappointing since we know that the underlying carbon efficiency of our plants has improved far more.Our carbon footprint for steel has reduced by 21% since 2007 - even though over this period the share of our production from the integrated route has increased from 77% to 83%, in response to changes in structural market demand. So, even though we are making more steel in this way, any increase in emissions has been more than outweighed due to improvements in the technical carbon efficiency of our steel plants. As a result, we have managed to achieve a relatively constant average carbon intensity since 2007. Today this stands at 2.12 tonnes of CO2 per tonne steel.Our efforts are now focused on building a roadmap to underpin a new medium-term 2030 target, which will be based on further technical efficiencies and the application of our portfolio of breakthrough technologies to reduce emissions.

The intensity baseline is based on our operations at the start of 2017 (not including Marine, Aviation, and Exploration from Gulf of Mexico and Senegal). Our performance will be based on estimated gross operated greenhouse gas emissions, stated in CO2e, divided by our gross operated production, stated in barrels of oil equivalent. The target is set in relation to our gross operated emissions as these are the emissions over which we have the most control. The target applies to both Scope 1 emissions and Scope 2 emissions. We report our operated emissions in the following regions, countries and provinces in accordance with regulation: Australia , European Union, Norway, United Kingdom, Alberta, Canada, British Columbia, Canada, Indonesia and United States. See http://www.conocophillips.com/sustainability/managing-climate-related-risks/metrics-targets/ghg-emissions/ for more information. There are similarities in the way that we have framed the target to the way the Paris Agreement has been framed. The Paris process uses 'Nationally Determined Contributions' (NDCs) to set interim performance targets that are reviewed on a five-year basis to move toward achieving the agreement's objective. We intend to review and adjust our performance target in a similar way. Science-Based Targets require us to include Scope 3 emissions. For E&P companies, the emissions from use of sold products is not in the scope of our control and leads to significant double-counting. In terms of specific methodology, the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach has not developed a methodology for the energy sector. The 100% of target achieved reflects the fact that our 2018 GHG intensity, calculated with the same methodology as our baseline, exceeds a 10% intensity reduction.

By 2050, our ambition is to align Shell's NCF with the footprint of the energy mix in the global energy system. We aim to reduce the NCF of the energy products we sell (in grams of CO2 equivalent per megajoule consumed) by around 50% by 2050.Early 2019, Shell decided to set a NCF target for 2021 of 2-3% lower than our 2016 NCF of 79 grams of CO2 equivalent per megajoule. This energy transition condition is included in performance conditions for the 2019 long-term incentive plan grant. It will include the first three-year target to reduce the NCF of the energy products we sell and will also include other measures that will help us achieve our strategic ambitions in the long term, related to the growth of Shell's Power business, commercialising opportunities in advanced biofuel technology and development of systems to capture and store carbon.The energy transition condition applies to Executive Directors, Executive Committee members and around 150 of Shell's senior executives in 2019.NOTE:- Non-energy products outside of NCF scope include chemical feedstocks or products, lubricants and bitumen.- The ''% of emissions in scope\" is estimated based on our total emissions including full life cycle emissions from them.

Our NCF Ambition is not an absolute emission target. The \"Net Carbon Footprint\" is also not a mathematical derivation of total emissions divided by total energy. It is a weighted average aggregation of lifecycle CO2 intensities of different energy products normalizing them to the same point relative to their final end-use.Please find details at: https://www.shell.com/energy-and-innovation/the-energy-future/what-is-shells-net-carbon-footprint-ambition/faq.html";NA;NA;NA;2;-0.5;0.4;2018;"2018-12-31";81000000;"C5.1 2018 S1, C5.1 2018 S2M";NA;NA;82000000;"C6 2019 S1, C6 2019 S2M";NA;NA;"-6c-0cb-0hb-0fb-0fb-0fb-0fb-0fb-0rcd-0rcb-0rec-0rce-0rca-0rce-0rca-0rcb-0rcd-0rec-6fn";"Missing info: % change anticipated in absolute Scope 1+2 emissions, % change anticipated in absolute Scope 3 emissions; Organizational changes: Change in methodology: 0.7% decreased in 2018,  Acquisitions: 1.7% increased in 2018,  Other: 1.0% increased in 2018,  Change in boundary: 1.4% decreased in 2018,  Divestment: 4.4% decreased in 2018, Change in boundary: 1.8% decreased in 2017,  Divestment: 2.4% decreased in 2017,  Acquisitions: 4.1% increased in 2017,  Change in methodology: 0.2% decreased in 2017,  Other: 2.4% increased in 2017";"16012-int-S12M3-2016-2021-1";"intensity"

The intensity ratio covers the total output from SSE's thermal (oil, gas, coal, multifuel) and renewable (wind, both onshore and offshore, hydro including pumped storage and biomass) electricity generation portfolio.Performance against the target: SSE's target is to reduce the carbon intensity of the electricity it generates by 50% by 2030, based on 2018 levels. This means that SSE's electricity generation carbon intensity is now forecast to be around 150gCO2e/kWh by 2030, which represents a 75% cut based on its original 2006 baseline.Between 2017/18 and 2018/19 the carbon intensity of SSE's generated electricity fell by 7% from 305gCO2e/kWh to 284gCO2e/kWh, as a result of changes in its generation output mix. SSE had a record year of renewable generation output and this, combined with a reduction in the coal-fired and gas- and oil-fired generation output, resulted in the reduction in carbon intensity.It is important to note that SSE does not expect the achievement of this target in 2030 to have followed a linear year-to-year reduction path. Market driven and weather related fluctuations may mean there are some years in which emissions may increase. However, SSE fully expects to achieve its 2030 target and the long-term trend continues to be significant reduction in the carbon intensity of the electricity it generates.This is a science based target. The science based target was assessed using SSE's internal model based on the UK government's Climate Change Act 2008 ambitions. In addition, this science based target was assessed using the SBTi Sector Decarbonisation Approach methodology by SSE.
